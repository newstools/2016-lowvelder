 MBOMBELA – A truck and driver went missine in the Khayelitsha area in the Cape on Friday and it is believed that the vehicle might be in the Lowveld. Mr Clive Nkiwani, who drove the truck, left the office as usual to perform his duties in the Goodwood and Maitland areas. Numerous attempts were allegedly made to contact him, but to no avail. “According to the vehicle tracking device, the truck was stationary for two hours, and we initially thought that he might have been robbed or the truck broke down,” said his employer. Another driver was sent to go and check on him, but the truck was already gone. “We are offering a reward for anyone that can lead us to the stolen truck, and the suspect,” the employer said. Anyone with information can contact 072-942-8862, 083-337-4077 or 021-931-964.
