 Mr Sipho Monareng said his party’s aim is to restore people’s dignity. He appears top of the EFF’s public representatives list for what will become the City of Mbombela Local Municipality after August 3. He has a good understanding of the administration of local government, where he has served as, among others, an adviser to what is now termed the mayor of a district-level municipality. Monareng recently joined the EFF after leaving the ANC because the parties’ policies are similar. “It is a young party where I believe I can make a difference. He added that the EFF is striving to attain a non-racial society. “First and foremost we need economic freedom. If we eliminate poverty we can achieve non-racialism.” His main focus will be on the provision of water. “People require water to do so many things. Yet most people in rural areas only have access to communal taps, which are often dry. Our programmes will also give people decent work. We will ensure the removal of the tender system to employ people directly,” he said. EFF and ANC clash at Sopa ANC Mpumalanga faction claims leadership election is rigged
