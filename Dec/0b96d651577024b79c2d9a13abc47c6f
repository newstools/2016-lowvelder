MBOMBELA &#8211; In the true spirit of Christmas, the community came together to help a four-year-old boy and his family pay for an eye operation he desperately needed. Cyrus Potgieter was born with ptosis, commonly known as &#8220;lazy eye&#8221;. His family could not afford it as they have two special-needs children and had been drained financially. Cyrus will require the operation every two years as he grows. Last Tuesday he was operated on at Medicross Silverton in Pretoria by Prof Paul Roux. His father, Mr Huey Potgieter, said Cyrus had bravely undergone the surgery and was already at home recovering. &#8221;
