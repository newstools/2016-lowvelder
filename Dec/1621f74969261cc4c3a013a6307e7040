MBOMBELA &#8211; Your family pets are not the only ones traumatised by the deafening noise of fireworks. According to White River SPCA chairperson, Ms Estelle de Villiers, wildlife also gets affected and also the bird life in the area.&#8220;Birds are breeding this time of the year and what goes up must come down as well. It has a devastating effect on wildlife and domesticated animals.&#8221;She said even some humans were badly affected by the use of fireworks. &#8220;Some people who have been through traumatic events get deeply affected by the noise,&#8221; she said.De Villiers added that fireworks were old fashioned and not the only way to celebrate the new year. She said only backward thinking people used fireworks. &#8220;Most people are aware of conservation and living peacefully with nature. Using fireworks is as abhorred by society as poaching is.&#8221;Animals have a more sensitive sense of hearing than humans do, so noises that are a little loud to humans are downright deafening to them. When panicked, animals will do most anything to get away from a frightening situation. They will break and jump through glass windows and even scale tall walls if necessary.She said this year people have come together to rally against the use of fireworks. &#8220;We are seeing a lot of security companies and local organisations taking a stand against this abuse on animals.&#8221;De Villiers said the SPCA would be on standby tonight for any emergency situations. The emergency number is 082 706 1240.Nelspruit Concerned Citizen&#8217;s (NCC) Mr John Meintjies said they had given out verbal warnings last night to people using fireworks in non-designated areas.&#8220;This is not so much about the enforcement but more about educating the public around the laws and implications of not complying with the designated areas.&#8221;READ MORE: Mbombela releases list of approved fireworks sites
