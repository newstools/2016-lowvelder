MBOMBELA &#8211; The concept of a tattoo fashion show evoked images of models showing off the latest, creative work of tattoo artists, offering tattoo fanatics the opportunity to peruse the latest fashion in tattoo design, but the event seemed to be less about tattoos, and more about fashion.Sarah Cue, the owner of Cue&#8217;s Tattoos, assisted by Shelly Cue and Kelly Telford, showed off impressive artwork on models in the first part of the show. Models Tiaan &#8220;Spyker&#8221; Venter, Michael van Tonder, Bennie Potgieter and Leslay Schonfeldt, displayed their body art with their own unique enthusiasm, providing much-awaited entertainment.Also read: Loock to compete at Arnold ClassicsAfter the punk show, which was the final part that could be associated with tattoos, Hillicks Models and Talent (HMT) showcased beautiful garments, men in suits and ladies in evening wear, the latter walking to classical music.Organiser, Danieta Neuhoff from Jay&#8217;s Modeling Agency, said the aim of the format used was to illustrate the contrast between tattooed and the non-tattooed bodies.Neuhoff said her daughter&#8217;s love of tattoos inspired her to organise the show. She sports two tattoos herself.I wanted to introduce the tatoo artists to the public. Many people still think tattoos are dirty. They are not. People may look different on the outside, but were are all people.&#8221;Other entertainment included hip-hop dancer Owen&#8217;s energetic showcasing of his skills. He also partnered with Michelle from Dancetique Studio in a great mambo dance routine.Some of the few people who attended, left disappointed, and exhibitors complained it amounted to &#8220;false advertising, misrepresentation and a low-budget event&#8221;.The venue also left a lot to be desired, with fans hanging loose from the ceiling, missing cover panels and dirty walls and floors. Neuhoff added that she was disappointed with the hall, and would not use it again.The venue also contributed to a poor showing, with out-of-towners failing to find it, and as a result little of the money for charity, was raised. She added that as it was her first show and she appreciated the support shown by the people who attended.She is also planning to continue organising interesting shows, such as the the Gay Fashion Show next year.
