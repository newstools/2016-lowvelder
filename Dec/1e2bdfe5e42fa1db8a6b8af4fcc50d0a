MBOMBELA &#8211; Local franchise SPAR lauched a Santa Drive last week, inviting Santa Clause to spread some Christmas cheer in the Lowveld.Santa and his trusty helpers visited SPARs in Phalaborwa, Lulekani, Hoedspruit, Lydenburg, Graskop, Malalane and Mbombela.Santa ventured into the Lowveld, handing out more than 400 gifts over the course of four days to the children along the way, hearing their wishes, and giving them all a hug before handing over a present.His helpers searched through every SPAR to find every child they could, to spread the love and make this year&#8217;s Holiday season a special one.To top it all off, Lowvelder found Santa&#8217;s brother, right here in Mbombela!Also read: Teen in dire need of funds.
