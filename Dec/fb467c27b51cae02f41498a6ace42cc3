MBOMBELA &#8211; The Paws @ Penryn walk was a huge success on Sunday. The organisers raised more than R10 000.Two grade-four girls from this school decided to organise a walk to raise funds for the SPCA&#8217;s vet bill at Van Wijk Street Animal Hospital.Members of the community, pupils and parents showed up bright and early to walk their pets on the school grounds.There were prizes to be won for the furry family members, and every pet received a rabies shot. It was wonderful to see dozens of dogs within a few feet from each other, all eager to play and explore. Big breeds like German shepherds, trotted with small breeds like terriers, enjoying the day out.The two organisers, Kayla Kirton and Caitlyn Nel, consider the day a success as the girls had no way of knowing what the turnout would be. The funds will cover at least 10 percent of the total bill.Also read: Medical aid shatters local dancer&#8217;s dream
