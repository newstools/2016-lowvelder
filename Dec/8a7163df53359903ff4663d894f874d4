ELANDSHOEK &#8211; One of the Lowveld&#8217;s well-known crime-fighters was called to a scene where his own flesh and blood had been attacked over the weekend. The family that had been targeted on a Ngodwana farm in the early hours of Friday was Mr Albert Gryvenstein of Bossies Community Justice, brother. &#8220;I got the shock of my life when I got a call about a family that was attacked on their farm.It was then that I realised it was my brother and his family. I rushed there not knowing what I would find,&#8221; he said. The victim, Mr Paul Gryvenstein, said he had always been terrified of waking up to a man holding a gun to his face. &#8220;That fear was realised, only there were four of them. They had the audacity to enter my house,&#8221; Paul said.Four suspects cut their fence and used a pick to wrench the house door open. The suspects were wearing balaklavas. &#8220;They kept telling us to look down, so I was only able to see their shoes and pants,&#8221; he said. Family members were forced to lie down on the cold tile floor in a room with their hands and feet tied behind their backs while the men looted whatever valuables they could find. &#8220;They stole whatever was in front of them and put it in the back of my bakkie.&#8220;One of the suspects stayed in the room with us. They kept saying they were doing this because they did not have jobs and would not hurt us,&#8221; he said. Paul added that the only time the suspects got aggressive was when his son asked his mother in Afrikaans if she was alright.&#8220;They kicked him and told him they would hurt him if he spoke Afrikaans.&#8221; He said luckily none of them had been injured during the incident.The suspects got away with firearms, TVs, jewellery, cellphones and whatever else they could carry. Paul managed to free himself and run to the nearest neighbour for help after the suspects fled with his Ford Ranger. A manhunt for the suspects was launched. Later that day at about 09:00 a farmer called Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit to report a vehicle abandoned on the Mataffin Road, which turns off by the Kaapsehoop Road. Hi-Tech&#8217;s response manager, Mr Callum MacPherson, said they found the vehicle they had been searching for which belonged to Paul. &#8220;We did not find any of the other stolen items,&#8221; he said. Provincial police spokesman, Sgt Gerald Sedibe, confirmed that a case had been opened and police were investigating the matter. Over the past few weeks, attacks on farms have been reported in the Hazyview, White River and Ngodwana areas.Lowvelder reported on two previous incidents in which Mr Mark Hadiaris was killed and Mr Kobus Koekemoer was injured. &#8220;We cannot confirm that these incidents are in any way related, nor can we confirm that the seeming rise of these crimes have anything to do with the time of year. &#8220;Crime is a constant threat and we must always be vigilant,&#8221; said Sedibe. He added that the police were investigating the three incidents.Read more here: I want to rape you, says evil-eyed farm attacker
