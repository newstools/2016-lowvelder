MBOMBELA &#8211; Old school was cool at this year&#8217;s local instalment of the TOPS at SPAR Wine Show. With the apt vintage theme, South Africa s favourite consumer-wine expo&#8217;s second time in the city attracted around 1 600 wine tasters to Emnotweni over the course of the three days last week.A range of exhibitors instructed layman wine lovers and those who consider themselves connoisseurs in the making of their wines from last Thursday. Wine tasters swirled, sipped and savoured some of the best cellars in the country right on their doorstep.With more than 250 different vinos to choose from, you could pick and choose your favourites, and buy a bottle or two to take home straight from the exhibitors. Fantastic specials were on offer, as was the opportunity to purchase wines at cellar-door prices.Beyerskloof was a favourite with repeat customers, offering a variety of wines on display. &#8220;It&#8217;s the type of wine you want to save for special occasions,&#8221; said one of the attendees.The party was well on its way with more than happy tasters, and with food and snacks on offer close by, friend and family groups could make a night of the event.Food lovers were in for a treat with a mouth-watering menu prepared by chefs from Emnotweni. Paired with fine wine, as a taster or whole meal, gourmands also had their fill at the expo.The Aramex stand had a game going, where tasters could snap a selfie in front of the stand, post it on Facebook, and then spin a wheel. Once they spun, they would win whatever prize they landed on. One lucky taster won a R500 voucher for Yuppiechef.With the Lowvelder Wine Theater and Magical Marc, there was no shortage of entertainment. A firm favourite among guests, the theatre offered interactive tastings and talks about wine.To round off the evening, Good Fellas manned the exits to offer any tasters who enjoyed the event a little too much, a safe ride home.Also see: Winner of La Bri wine pairing with winning recipe&nbsp;
