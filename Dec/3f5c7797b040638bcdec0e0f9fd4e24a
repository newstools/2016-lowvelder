That is a promise.&#8221; The emotional, spiritually significant devotion was made by farm-attack survivor Sue Hadiaris on Sunday. It was eight days after she had seen her husband, the Lowveld&#8217;s beloved biltong man, die. Her vow rose from deep within, moulded by things that are unseen. She trusts in her faith, has purpose in her motherhood of 12-year-old Scott, and cherishes the most beautiful memories of the kind, wise man she was married to. Sue feels comforted by the people of the Lowveld. &#8220;This is what gets me through. Our community is wonderful beyond words,&#8221; she told Lowvelder on Tuesday. Armed with what is in her heart and mind and the support that surrounds her, she will keep Mark&#8217;s Biltong going. &#8220;Starting in January, I&#8217;ll be wherever he was. I must warn you all that his man-sized mini tote is a bit too big for me to carry. I&#8217;ll sell Mark&#8217;s biltong from a basket,&#8221; she said with a laugh. Sue has already returned to work, but required the paper not to divulge her place of work as the men who killed Mark and attacked her, are still on the run. Lowvelder previously reported that Sue remembers the faces of their attackers clearly. The two men charged them in the early morning hours of Saturday. They robbed the couple of various items, shot Mark, assaulted Sue and threatened to rape her before she could hit a panic button. When security officials arrived, they fled. Mark&#8217;s life was celebrated over the weekend. After she rehashed what had happened, she paused, then marvelled. &#8220;Did you know that this was the second attack I had been through?&#8221; The first was six years ago in Johannesburg. Sue was preparing Milo in the kitchen on a sick day. &#8220;Shhhht,&#8221; a voice whispered behind her. She was struck off her feet, dragged through her home and tied up in her room. &#8220;They used cable ties,&#8221; she said. The men robbed Sue and fled afoot, hopping over the fence into the neighbour&#8217;s yard where they hijacked a vehicle. They were never caught. &#8220;Both times, I kept calm somehow. This time, the trauma was much worse with Mark&#8217;s murder. But &#8220;I have assistance in the healing process. I have hands that hold me in the process of standing up, walking and moving towards 2017. In Johannesburg, I felt like a crime statistic. I could not have imagined having this support system. Today I am privileged and thankful beyond words,&#8221; she said. Bossie&#8217;s Community Justice has issued a reward of up to R50 000 for information that will lead to the successful arrest and prosecution of Mark&#8217;s killers. Sue made R5 000 available and community members added another R20 000. On Wednesday the police assisted her in compiling a facial profile of one of the suspects. &#8220;I will also send you a photo of a unique ring taken from me. If anyone spots it, it will lead the police to the crooks,&#8221; she said. Sue&#8217;s thanks towards the reward donors know no end. &#8220;I have faith in investigating officer WO Gerhard Botha. I can have faith and hope for the future because I am part of a community that is heaven-sent,&#8221; she said. Anyone with information pertaining to the incident may contact the police&#8217;s WO Gerhard Botha on 082-876-3572. A WhatsApp group will be set up for Mark&#8217;s Biltong, as Sue and Mark&#8217;s cellphones were stolen. If you would like to make contact, please send your name and surname to 071-413-5686.
