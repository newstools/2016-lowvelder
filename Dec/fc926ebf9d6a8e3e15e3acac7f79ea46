MBOMBELA &#8211; After months of construction and revamping, Courtside SPAR and TOPS on the corner of the N4 and Kaapsehoop Road, reopened their doors on December 1. Previously known as Tarentaal SPAR, this local business had a rough year as it had to close its doors when part of the roof and walls collapsed on December 23 last year.Nobody was seriously injured, but the SPAR and TOPS had their work cut out for them to rebuild and refurbish to a level that far surpasses the former stores. Promising to be bigger and better, the establishment hosted a social gathering last week Wednesday evening to celebrate the grand opening that would commence the next morning.The guests numbered around 90 people and they enjoyed finger foods, drinks, and music supplied by a DJ booth set up by the employees.Also read: Builders Warehouse trade event
