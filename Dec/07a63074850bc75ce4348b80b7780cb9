ROCKY DRIFT &#8211; A prize-winning show Staffie has a bullet lodged behind his oesophagus after a neighbour shot him on a property on the Curlews Road.Sir, a Best of Breeds and Best of Staffordshire winner, was shot in the throat with what is believed to be an air gun on Sunday. The bullet will remain in his throat until he can have specialist surgery.According to his owners, Ms Zuleka and Mr Chadwen Major, the incident turned a peaceful afternoon into a nightmare.&#8220;Our neighbour has geese and another farm owner here also has a few. Sometimes they come onto our property. Our dogs have never harmed them,&#8221; said Zuleka.The couple claimed that the neighbour, Mr Boet Botes, had come to their house before and threatened to shoot the dogs.&#8220;He used profanity, saying he will shoot our dogs because some of his geese had gone missing. When the other neighbour got rid of his dog the complaints ceased,&#8221; said Zuleka.The Majors said this was the first time this year that their dogs had escaped the yard. On the day Chadwen did not close the front security door&#8217;s pin-lock system properly, and all three Staffies got out. The family went in search of the dogs.&#8220;The other two did not go far, we called them back, but Sir crossed onto Boet&#8217;s property, &#8221; said Zuleka.&#8220;I went down all the way and I called Sir. I wanted to go over and apologise, but then I saw the blood on Sir&#8217;s neck as he ran to me,&#8221; said Chadwen.&#8220;My dog was there for less than five minutes, and he took it upon himself to get a gun, cock it, and shoot,&#8221; said Zuleka. It cannot been determined if the dog will live without surgery. White River Animal Hospital took X-rays and referred them to a specialist in Pretoria.The X-rays cost R1 000, and an approximate quote to have the bullet removed was more than R13 000.&#8220;Even then I have no guarantee that he will survive,&#8221; said Chadwen.X-rays of Sir show the bullet lodged behind his oesophagus.

Botes admitted to shooting Sir.&#8220;It&#8217;s simple. The dog came onto my farm, chased my geese, and I shot it.&#8221; Botes confirmed that he had warned the Majors before. He would not confirm if he had ever positively identified one of the Major&#8217;s dogs attacking his geese.&#8220;This is a farm area. I can&#8217;t see what happens or what is out here. I get there and some of my geese are dead or injured. It has happened a few times before. They have dogs. My front gate is open, my geese are in an enclosure here.&#8221;Also see: Video &#8211; Two lion cubs and a stickThe Majors reported the shooting to the SPCA, which advised them to lay a charge. Ms Lize Pienaar, chairman of the Nelspruit SPCA, told Lowvelder that the use of an air rifle to victimise or scare animals is not legal.&#8220;It is an offence against the Animal Protection Act, 71 of 1962. It is also an offence against the Firearms Act, 60 of 2000, in the event that the weapon is fired in a built-up city or town area.&#8220;The warrant officer I spoke with said he will come to investigate what happened, before they open a case,&#8221; said Chadwen. &#8220;My dog would probably lick a burglar to death, I don&#8217;t understand why anybody would want to hurt him.&#8221;Sir&#8217;s bullet entry wound.
