MBOMBELA &#8211; The Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison will soon introduce a system to assist in tracing motorists who have warrants of arrests for unpaid traffic violations. This project will be apart of the Traffic Intervention Unit (TIU). The defaulters will be arrested as prescribed by the warrants and also for contempt of court. MEC for the department, Mr Pat Ngomane, gave this directive to TIU to prepare the unit for the festive season at a meeting last Thursday.
