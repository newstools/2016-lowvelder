MBOMBELA &#8211; The health of a 67-year-old man is deteriorating, meanwhile Rob Ferreira Hospital does not have a doctor who is qualified to run the tests needed to investigate the cause. Mr Dumisani Malamule, spokesman for the Department of Health, confirmed that all provincial hospitals do not have doctors who are able do those particular tests, but he said plans were underway to recruit specialists. &#8220;We currently don&#8217;t have oncologists. We are working on acquiring professionals in that field, so that our people across the province have access the best health care,&#8221; he said.
