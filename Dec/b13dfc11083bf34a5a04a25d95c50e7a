LVCC won the toss on a cloudy Saturday morning and opted to bowl first on a green pitch which provided good assistance for the bowlers. The LVCC attack proved to be a handful, skittling Potts out for 109 before lunch, with paceman Roelof Jansen the pick of the bowlers with 4/33 in 10 overs.Jansen was well supported by Gavin Kirby (2/19 in 8 overs) and Rudi Jacobs (2/19 in 7.2 overs). Potts debutant, Dean McLuckie, top scored for the visitors with 31 from 56 balls. In response, Potts managed to stifle the scoring with some accurate bowling early on.But a stylish 34 from 43 balls by Dwayne Obermeyer, along with useful contributions from Noah Masha (29), Dale Hes (18) and Matthys Brink (17) saw LVCC securing a valuable 51 run lead before being bowled out late on the first day.Also read: Match keeps the legacy alivePotts opening bowler Doug Nupen was in superb form, sweeping 5/43 in 15 overs. The Potts opening batsmen managed to close the gap to just four runs before the end of the day, leaving the contest finely balanced going into Sunday.The match format dictates that each batting line-up only has six batsmen on the second day, and LVCC broke the resilient opening partnership early on another overcast morning.With fine bowling from Jacobs (3/26) and Gunther Swart (2/26), the Lowvelders managed to get the five required wickets with 97 runs on the board, leaving them a manageable target of 47 runs to win. Potts opener Shane Murphy top scored with 49 from 96 balls, the highest individual effort of the match.The Potts bowlers again showed fierce determination in defending a small total, restricting LVCC to 41/4 and taking the game to the wire.
