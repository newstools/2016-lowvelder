In 2013, the Missing Persons Bureau recorded 1 697 cases of missing children reported to SAPS. That equates to a child going missing every five hours.In 2016, however, it is difficult to get updated statistics, although the People Search and Rescue Unit (PSARU) claims that a child goes missing every six hours in South Africa.Whatever the correct numbers may be, there are many cases which go unregistered with the police or missing persons organisations. And there is reason to believe that human trafficking also has its part to play.In statistics released by Missing Children South Africa (MCSA), nine people from Mpumalanga, five of whom were children, were reported missing to the organisation from December 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016. MCSA is a registered non-profit organisation which assists the authorities when an individual goes missing in the country.Also read: Body of missing Swiss found at lastRose Mac Kinnon of MCSA, could not give a set reason as to why the recorded numbers are lower in one area compared with another. For example, 209 cases were reported in Gauteng, 137 in the Western Cape and 35 in the Eastern Cape.According to Mac Kinnon, &#8220;(The organisation&#8217;s) case load increases every year, not necessarily only because more individuals go missing, but also because more people become aware of MCSA and the service it renders.&#8221;Given Lekhuleni, who volunteers for Amazing Grace Children&#8217;s Home and other similar organisations, says the number of missing children may be higher in the Lowveld than what records show.It may well be the number is higher, but cases are not registered due to people&#8217;s lack of knowledge on how to file or why they should report such cases as a matter of urgency,&#8221; he says.&#8220;I think the police should educate the public about how important it is to file missing persons cases for the purpose of finding the individual unharmed or to record the case.&#8221;Lekhuleni says Amazing Grace Children&#8217;s Home works on creating awareness, carrying out community surveys, sheltering children in need and other services. There are branches in Malalane and Johannesburg.He has been actively involved in many investigations concerning children, especially those from neighbouring countries who are working in communities close to the border. He gives an example where minors &#8220;are being used for selling (goods) at the taxi rank when the main vendor&#8217;s children are at school&#8221;.&#8220;Most of these cases involve minor children on the move, smuggling and trafficking humans. When you ask those kids how they got to South Africa, you will be shocked,&#8221; Lekhuleni says.&#8220;Some come willingly with their family members, friends or on their own to make a living due to difficulties and poverty at home, but others are brought over the border by complete strangers with promises of a better life or schooling opportunities.The children end up being &#8220;used&#8221; for the stranger&#8217;s own benefit,&#8221; he adds.Also read: Missing girl found thanks to community organisationThe MCSA statistical report also states that the organisation is striving to make more people aware of the reality of human trafficking.&#8220;We are sure more cases are reported to SAPS as well as to our organisation because of human trafficking, but at this stage it cannot be proven,&#8221; it reads.&#8220;According to the International Labour Organisation, it is estimated that 1,2 million children are trafficked (globally) each year. Furthermore, $32 billion profit is generated annually from human trafficking.&#8221;MCSA is just one example of an organisation which works closely together with SAPS and other authorities to assist in the search for missing persons. Mac Kinnon emphasises, &#8220;We never stop looking for the missing person, nor do we close the case.&#8220;We are here to help everyone, from young to old. Everyone will always say it won&#8217;t happen to their child but when it does, you will need to have an organisation to create awareness around the missing person. We always say, it takes a village to find a child,&#8221; Mac Kinnon says.Some general safety tips from Missing Children SA and SAPS There is NO WAITING PERIOD for reporting a person missing to the nearest police station. Should you report a person to the police station and the police officer tells you to come back after 24 hours, demand to speak to the station commander. Or, alternatively, contact Missing Children SA or a similar organisation will intervene and assist wherever possible.When reporting a person missing to the police station, the following information will be required along with a recent photograph Full name of missing person Age of missing person Description of missing person (eye colour, hair colour/style, height, weight, distinctive birthmarks or scars, clothes the person was wearing) Where the person was last seen. Complete and sign a SAPS 55(A) form. This form safeguards the SAPS from hoax reports and indemnifies the SAPS to distribute the photograph and information of the missing person. Obtain the investigating officer&#8217;s contact details, and send any additional information that might become available. If a missing person is found or returns voluntarily, inform the investigating officer immediately.Organisations you can contact People Search and Rescue Unit (PSARU) &#8211; 0860-287-223, info@psaru.co.za, www.psaru.co.za Missing Children SA (MCSA) &#8211; 072-647-7464, info@missingchildren.org.za, www.missingchildren.org.za Child Welfare South Africa &#8211; Mbombela (013-753-3330), White River (013-750-1001) Human Trafficking Resource Line &#8211; 0800-222-777.
