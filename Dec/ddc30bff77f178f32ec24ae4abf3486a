MBOMBELA &#8211; Hundreds of orphans from Mataffin were treated to a special Christmas party last week. Milviforce Puma N4, owned by Tshepiso Phosa, hosted the Christmas party for 169 orphans last week on Thursday.Phosa, who has been involved with Woodhouse Community Care Base for three years, helped treat them to a beautiful day of gifts, food and love.Lucia Ochan, who was crowned the second princess in the recent Mrs Mpumalanga pageant, and a few Pumas rugby players joined in the festivities for the day.Some of the boys from Woodhouse participate in the Puma Kidz programme as part of their skills development.The home currently provides daily meals for 169 children between the ages of two and 19 who are from child-headed homes or unable to provide for their families because of unemployment.Phosa does not believe in a &#8220;drop and go&#8221;, which is why she made the decision to adopt the home. Phosa has also committed herself to bringing fun to the children once a month. Food, fun and games are provided for the children to enjoy at their doorstep as they are not able to go to the mall or theme parks by their own means.Woodhouse Community Care Base is a registered NPO and consists of three departments, Woodhouse Community Care Base, Mataffin Community Cr che and Mataffin Drop-in-Centre.Woodhouse&#8217;s main aim is to provide a feeding scheme to vulnerable children and the elderly. It educates the children about life skills and helps them with homework. It provides sports activities, teaches them about the prevention and spreading of HIV/Aids and educates them about teen pregnancy. Woodhouse encourages them to become the best they can be by having uplifting events and talks.&#8220;Being able to adopt this home and make a difference in some lives is a huge honour for me. It comes from my heart and I do what I can to make these kids&#8217; lives a little better,&#8221; said Phosa.Other sponsors included Bundu Lodge, Nelspruit Go and Sport Unplugged.Also see: Video &#8211; Two lion cubs and a stick
