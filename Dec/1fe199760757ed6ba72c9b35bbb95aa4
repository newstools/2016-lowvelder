MBOMBELA &#8211; Penryn College held a Christmas market from November 23 to 25.Librarian Kathy Holton ran the show, helping prospective customers and answering questions, while library assistant, Esther Magolego kept up with all the admin work. Products for sale ranged from clothing and accessory items to clothes for small dogs, creatively designed bags, ornaments and toys and of course, lots of books.The idea was to sell as many books as possible as the school received commission on the sales of the Travelling Bookshop. Other market vendors were offered space to sell their products as well.The flow of customers was slow yet steady. Toy wands and glow sticks were a particular hit.Also read: Paws @ Penryn&nbsp;&nbsp;
