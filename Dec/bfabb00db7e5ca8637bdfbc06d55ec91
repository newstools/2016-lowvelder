PHALABORWA &#8211; Horses might be back in active duty in the Kruger National Park (KNP) if a pilot programme launched in November is successful. They will be deployed for mounted anti-poaching patrols. Karien Keet, SANParks section ranger for Phalaborwa for 17 years, is in charge of the programme. &#8220;The first challenge would be to get the horses used to wildlife and to teach them how to react to animals. Horses will also have to be trained to get used to gunshots,&#8221;
