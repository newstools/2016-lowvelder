The Nelspruit Correctional Services only allows prisoners who have been sentenced to receive visitors on Christmas Day.This is its policy for all holidays.&#8220;Visitors are welcome to see prisoners that have not yet been sentenced on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays,&#8221; an employee told Lowvelder. Sentenced prisoners&#8217; visitor days or on Wednesdays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.Visiting times are from 09:00 to 14:30.Apart from visits from loved ones, prisoners may not have that much to look forward to on Christmas.Also read: The world&#8217;s biggest Christmas hymn choir The Department of Correctional Service&#8217;s employees do their bit to create a festive atmosphere with decorations and treats. Yet prisoners who have known only everyday circumstances in jail, are not looking forward to spending the day behind bars.This is how one local described life in jail:Upon his arrival, his fingerprints were taken and he was escorted to his first cell. His stay there felt like an initiation. &#8220;Apart from a thin strip of floor space, the whole room was filled with bunk beds. The beds didn&#8217;t have mattresses,&#8221; he recalled. A fellow inmate others had referred to as &#8220;the supervisor&#8221; handed him three blankets. One was crawling with bed bugs. He decided to use the blankets as a makeshift mattress.&#8220;It&#8217;s everything you&#8217;ve imagined, only worse. Cut off from everything and everyone with only your racing mind to keep you company, you get drawn into a very dark place. The constant sounds of cell doors being slammed closed and police officers walking up and down add to your feelings of despair. And then there&#8217;s the other 14 people in your cell,&#8221; he said with a shiver.Lees ook: Geliefde veldwagter herstel na rugbesering &nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m talking real criminals. The kind you read about. You&#8217;re stuck in there with them. The cell has two tiny windows. And four walls that seem to be pushing inward, filling you with anxiety and fear.&#8221; Van der Berg also said that the police cells reeked of urine, because the detainees don&#8217;t bother to walk towards the toilet before doing their business. &#8220;You try to sleep on the same floor they had urinated on,&#8221; he said.The next day his photo was taken and he received a card with his basic information and the charges levelled against him. He was also handed his prison uniform. &#8220;Mine was yellow. Only when you have been sentenced, do you get the trademark orange jumpsuit,&#8221; he explained. He was transferred to another cell where those accused of so-called &#8220;less serious&#8221;crimes were his cell mates. His fellow cell mates had been accused of rape and murder, respectively.&#8220;These cells had sponge mattresses on the beds. A sheet cover would cost me two cigarettes, as would a sheet to sleep under,&#8221; he said. Luckily, Van der Berg had cigarettes with him and could trade for these necessities.According to the man, prison life was pretty monotonous, except for the occasional fight that might result in someone being stabbed.&#8220;The food is by no means delicious,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but if you don&#8217;t eat it, you&#8217;ll die.&#8221;The source has since been released.
