MBOMBELA &#8211; A Durban man who was initially found guilty of masterminding a hand-grenade attack which shocked the Valencia community 10 years ago, is a free man. Mr Yegen Naidoo&#8217;s (47) murder convictions were overturned by three judges in the Pretoria High Court on June 9. Ms Patricia Pillay (53) and her granddaughter, Yetska (9) were killed when a hand grenade was thrown into their home in Valencia, two days before Christmas in 2006. Family member, Ms Taryn Chetty, said the family was shocked, disheartened and angry because they thought they could finally get closure. &#8220;Although we cannot bring back our loved ones, we would have had some kind of comfort in the fact that all the guilty parties would pay the price for their horrendous actions,&#8221; she said.
