It has been a long year, and just like you, your wallet also needs a break. Buying gifts for your loved ones does not necessarily need to break the bank &#8211; in fact, it doesn&#8217;t have to cost a cent, you just need to put some thought into it. Sometimes less is more.When you want to give something special to your loved one, why not write them a letter, stating how much they mean to you. Even if you don&#8217;t have the best handwriting, you still need to write the letter to make it more personal.Although this is not recommended, regifting (giving an unwanted gift that one has received to someone else as a gift) is also an option. This is, however, very dangerous and should not be attempted in the vicinity of the gift giver.Photo frames are great to portray the good times had by you and a loved one. To print a photo usually costs between R5 and R20. Buy a decent frame to accompany your great memories caught on camera.Here are a list of other small gifts that mean a lot: Gourmet coffee with a personalised mug Homemade cookies you bake yourself A burned CD with all the person s favorite songs. Books Personalised T-shirt.
