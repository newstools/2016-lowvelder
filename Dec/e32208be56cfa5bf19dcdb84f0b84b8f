1. Test your house alarm well in advance. If there is a fault, call a technician immediately to make repairs. Also make sure that flapping curtains or roaming pets will not activate your alarm s motion sensors while you are away.2. If you are leaving a key with your neighbour, ask him or her to clear out your post box regularly and turn the lights on at night. It is also quite simple to set up manual timers on certain lights so they turn on and off automatically. Inform your security company that your neighbour has a key in case of emergencies.3. Cancel all newspaper and magazine deliveries for the period you will be away. If you forget, have a family member or a neighbour collect them for you.4. Consider asking a friend or family member to house-sit for you or ask them to stop by the house regularly so that there is some activity. If you have a house sitter, remember to let your security company know.5. Never advertise that you are going away. If possible, pack your car behind closed garage doors or out of sight of the road.
