MBOMBELA &#8211; According to Mr Joseph Ngala, spokesman for the City of Mbombela Local Municipality, the report was not ready in time for Cllr Sibusiso Mathonsi to properly prepare for the meeting.&#8220;It is quite an extensive report and we wanted to be fair to him,&#8221; Ngala told Lowvelder.Instead, the sitting opened with a loud, impassioned sermon by Past G Mkhonto of Summer Hill Church International.&#8220;When Mbombela makes it, we all make it. We need to learn to love and forgive one another,&#8221; Mkhonto said.The term &#8216;formal&#8217; created quite a stir after EFF&#8217;s Cllr Lucky Shongwe asked for further clarification on the Party Whips Forum discussion, in terms of dress code earlier that morning.He was berated by DA and ANC members for playing political sports and the debate was brought to an end when ANC chief whip, Cllr Meshack Nsimbini, told the council that all parties besides the EFF had agreed on the dress code.When Shongwe wanted to argue further, acting Speaker, Cllr Morris Mazibane, asked for his microphone to be switched off.Also read: New municipality convenesRecommendations by the executive mayor were also discussed including those relating to the transfer of land to Mpumalanga provincial government for the establishment of a parliamentary village.DA councillor, Elsie Janse van Rensburg, requested a recommendation be added for national treasury to make available a conditional grant of R66 095 million to acquire land for human settlement in the City of Mbombela municipal area in exchange for the Maggiesdal farm portions which are being transferred.&#8220;The topography of the land was not suitable to build low-cost housing and will be used for the establishment of a parliamentary village instead. That is fine and good but we would like to be compensated,&#8221; she told Lowvelder.&#8220;We did not lose the money but we lost the capacity to buy land for human settlement.&#8221; Mathonsi responded by saying it was a &#8220;dangerous recommendation&#8221; by the councillor and proposed that it not be added as this was land purchased by government as was remaining in government.&#8220;Although the mayor said it was within government, the local municipality lost the asset value of the land with the transfer. There are many houses currently at Maggiesdal. When the parliamentary village comes, where will those people go? We need to have money to find suitable land to settle those families,&#8221; Janse van Rensburg explained.Mathonsi told the paper that he hopes to be able to present his 100-days report at the next sitting of council which should be held this week. An announcement of the next sitting has not yet been announced.Also watch: VIDEO: Clean-up follows I langa incident
