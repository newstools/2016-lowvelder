MBOMBELA &#8211; Lowvelder has some creative and inexpensive ways to spruce up your home during this happy time. Metallic colours are all the rage in home decor. If you are a little tired of the traditional red, green and gold Christmas colour scheme, why not extend this trend by decorating indoors with bronze, gold, rose gold, and silver decorations? Stick to the metallic colour scheme though. A mixture of all different colours could look a bit odd. If you have kiddies running around, why not get them to do a holiday project and make a few decorations for the Christmas tree? There are lots of easy examples on the Internet and it will keep them out of mischief for a day or two; from cotton-wool angels and bottle-top snowmen to paper snowflakes and tin table decorations. Make a wreath for your door out of indigenous plants from the garden. You would be surprised how much of a positive reaction you get from your holiday guests. And it makes for a proudly South African, Christmas-in-summer gesture. Proteas are a little pricey but look beautiful. Switch up the throws and pillow cases on your chairs, couches and beds. It will bring more colour into your house and will add to the festive cheer. Who could be down in the dumps after seeing Rudolph with his red nose staring at you from the sofa? And you can put them away for next year, just like you do with your Christmas decorations.Have some fun making your home look and feel festive this season.
