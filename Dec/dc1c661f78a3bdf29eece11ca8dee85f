MBOMBELA &#8211; Well-above normal rainfall is expected during the summer, but this may give rise to flooding instead of more water in the taps. Users are urged to continue to use water as sparingly as possible.According to Mr Richmond Jele, spokesman for Sembcorp Silulumanzi, there has been only a slight improvement in the level of the Kwena Dam, which supplies the Crocodile River with water.&#8220;The report (on November 30) indicates the level of Kwena Dam to be at 23,7 per cent. The Kwena Dam must be at least on 55 per cent by the end of this summer, otherwise we might experience challenges through the winter months,&#8221; he said.In November 2015 the level of Kwena Dam stood at 72 per cent.There are only two or three months until the winter season. At this stage, it isn&#8217;t looking too good,&#8221; Jele added.Other dams in the Inkomati water-management area have seen an increase in water levels over the past month. Vygeboom and Nooitgedacht have shown increases from 23 per cent and 46,7 per cent to percentages of 69,8 and 60,7. Witklip, Da Gama and Inyaka dam levels have increased only marginally.Also read: Extreme heat aggravates droughtMr Masala Mulaudzi of the Department of Water and Sanitation, said the improvement of just under five per cent in the water-storage capacity for the province over the past two weeks is not adequate. It stands at 49,8 per cent.&#8220;We are still worried as we are still a long way from full recovery. It will take a while before the situation returns to normal as the impact of drought has been severe,&#8221; he told Lowvelder.Water restrictions have been implemented in the City of Mbombela, Nkomazi and Bushbuckridge municipalities.We urge members of the public to continue to use water sparingly,&#8221; Mulaudzi said.In its most recent seasonal climate watch for December 2016 to April 2017, the South African Weather Service (SAWS) stated that South Africa&#8217;s summer rainfall areas can expect wetter conditions during the mid-summer through to the early autumn period.It warns that despite the positive conditions mentioned above, most parts of the country are still firmly in the grasp of severe drought conditions.&#8220;The forecasting system also indicates the possibility of well-above normal rainfall conditions over the summer rainfall region of South Africa, which, given the current drought effects, may have negative impacts if flooding should occur,&#8221; the report read.Also read:It indicated better chances for below-normal temperature conditions for the northern part of the country, which will be welcome news for many Lowvelders.Meanwhile, Ms Linda Grimbeek, chief operating officer at the Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism, said the organisation is closely monitoring the water situation in the City of Mbombela Local Municipality.We are pushing for water penalties to be enforced better and with more vigour. We need to police it and get the perpetrators to pay,&#8221; she said.According to Grimbeek, one of the biggest challenges is water lost because of leaks which are not reacted to fast enough. She added that the the chamber is following up on what is being done about the situation.Jele added that Sembcorp Silulumanzi has &#8220;a dedicated team of plumbers deployed in all our areas of operation identifying and fixing water leaks&#8221;.&#8220;The biggest challenge is some illegal water connections that have been made by community members to water-pump lines in Pienaar and Matsulu,&#8221; he said.Also read: Water Restoration Programme to equip communities
