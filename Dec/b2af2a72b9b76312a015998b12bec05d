MBOMBELA &#8211; &#8220;An elephant is killed by poachers, the tusks hacked out, and within 24 hours has left the shores of Africa, on its way to China, Vietnam, Hong Kong and many other countries. There is an elephant murdered every 15 minutes for its ivory.&#8221; These are just some of the shocking statistics elephant expert and author, Bob Preller, shared with the audience at the second instalment of Lowvelder&#8217;s Pen in my Hand on Thursday. He was in the Lowveld to promote his book, The Silent Giants of Southern Africa: Including the Desert Giants of the Kaokoveld. &#8220;The demise and extinction of the elephant is a real and possible reality.
