SKUKUZA &#8211; Groundbreaking technology in the form of a wide-area surveillance system has been added to SANParks&#8217; arsenal to protect vulnerable species.The system, known as the Postcode Meerkat, was launched in the Kruger National Park (KNP) on Wednesday.It was made possible thanks to lottery players in the United Kingdom.South African National Parks (SANParks), Peace Parks Foundation and South Africa&#8217;s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), have partnered to research, develop and manufacture this innovative system.Postcode Meerkat comprises a suite of radar and electro-optic sensors that will detect, classify, monitor and track humans moving in the park over a wide area.In addition, it has been designed to be mobile so that it can be rapidly deployed to prevent poaching crisis zones from developing.Smart thinking in its development allows it to differentiate between humans and animals, while its application will guarantee early warning and rapid-response capabilities.This will augment ranger reaction times, allow for better preparation and support the proactive apprehension of poachers, which could save the lives of both humans and animals.It also has the future potential to be used in a conservation role, for example to better understand animal behaviour.Postcode Meerkat will significantly increase the KNP&#8217;s ability to protect rhino and other vulnerable species.It will enhance its capacity to combat wildlife crime, along with the many other systems already put in place, such as improved ranger skills and support, increased aerial and ground mobility, gate access control and zones with increased wildlife protection.Apart from developing and manufacturing the system, the CSIR will also provide ongoing technical and administrative support to the KNP.Funding for the development and deployment of the Postcode Meerkat was secured by Peace Parks Foundation from the People&#8217;s Postcode Lottery of the UK.People&#8217;s Postcode Lottery is a charity lottery. Participants play with their postcodes to win cash prizes, while raising money for charities and good causes across Great Britain, and globally. A minimum of 30 per cent goes directly to charities and players have raised 154,8 million for good causes so far. It is part of Novamedia, the world&#8217;s third largest private charity donor, which has collected 6,6 billion for charity since its inception 25 years ago.
