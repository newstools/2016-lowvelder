At this festive time of year, with many people already on leave; the weather tends to be foremost in the minds of the public. Will it be sunny and hot, so that my children can swim in the pool? Will it rain while I am driving to my holiday destination? Will I be safe where I am? With this in mind, the South African Weather Service has compiled a brief overview of the weather to be expected during the weekend, as well as the weather prospects for early next week.READ MORE: Tornadoes: Nature s hardest weather event to predictThe Lowveld regions of Mpumalanga and Limpopo can expect swelteringly hot and humid conditions today, with maximum temperatures rising to close to 40 C and even exceeding 40 C in places. Phalaborwa can expect to reach 40 C, while 42 C is predicted for Skukuza today. Holidaymakers in the Kruger Park would be best advised to ensure that hats, shades and liberal applications of a high SPF sunblock are the order of the day. The good news is that there will be some relief from the heat in the Lowveld during the coming weekend, as the ridging of a surface high is expected to introduce cooler air on Saturday as well as Sunday. There is a 30 per cent chance of rain predicted for Saturday, and 60 per cent for Sunday.Notwithstanding the suppressive effect of the upper-ridge in terms of rainfall prospects, conditions for the development of thundershowers are somewhat better over the eastern provinces for today as well as the weekend. While, in general, expected amounts of rainfall are not likely to be heavy, many places could look forward to at least about 10-20mm per day &#8211; enough to keep conditions from getting too hot (and hopefully enough to keep one s garden plants from wilting!). During the next few days, storms should generally be short-lived and mostly non-severe, however, the South African Weather Service does have a Watch in place today (Friday 9th).READ MORE: A round-up of the extreme weather conditions in SA
