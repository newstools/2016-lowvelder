MARLOTH PARK &#8211; An interesting video of two wildebeest bulls in action (or not in action!) showed behaviour that got lovers of wild life talking. It was posted by Bradley Ballantyne on November 27.Lowvelder asked an animal expert to give his opinion on the behaviour.&#8220;To me it looks like a territorial dispute. The bull that is bullying the one on the ground seems to want to push the other bull out of his territory. It might be possible that the one lying down is already hurt, externally or internally. He might also be very tired and that is why he is lying down. Eventually the one lying down decides to clear out but the other makes sure that he is leaving the territory,&#8221; said dr. Gerhard Verdoorn from the Griffon Poison Information Centre.Want to know more about wildebeest behaviour? See more territorial wildlife behaviour here&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
