MBOMBELA &#8211; On December 22 Sylvia Jabu Sikhonde, a ward clerk at the female orthopaedic ward at Rob Ferreira, was walking with a co-worker in the halls of the hospital when a patient attacked her. Sikhonde was on her way to the registry, passing the X-rays office when a patient came running towards her. I moved out of his way when I saw him coming, but he came straight at me. He started beating my face with his fist. I fell down and screamed for help. He was also kicking me, said Sikhonde. She reported that she woke up to two doctors trying to assist her, and the staff of the X-ray department were restraining the patient.Sikhonde claimed that she had surgery on her right leg in 2014 after sustaining a fracture. She allegedly also had another fracture near her left ankle in September of this year. She recently had surgery to treat gall stones, and only returned to work on December 5.Also see: N4 Claims another life Now I am hurt again. My ankle and right knee are swollen and sore.
