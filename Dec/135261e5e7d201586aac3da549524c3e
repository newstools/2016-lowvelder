 Early on Monday morning the birds in our garden at Wayfarers Guest House got into a state of uproar. My partner, Merle Joubert, suspected straight away that they were protesting at the intrusion of an unwelcome visitor. Upon investigation she spotted the cause of the noise, a female boomslang was stalking two young Heuglinâ€™s Robin chicks. We saw the snake a couple of times, and it was a large specimen, but it was also very evasive. We phoned Denzil Lawrie for assistance, but he was away in the Free State. Merle phoned Platoland Veterinary Service, and very shortly thereafter, Rudi van Maanen arrived. The snake proved impossible to pin down, and Rudi returned to work. However, Davide Nangue, our gardener, kept an eye out and eventually the intruder was discovered up the tree where the robins had their nest. Rudi was summoned again, and returned almost immediately. After a short skirmish the very elusive snake was expertly snared, and after posing for a photograph, was safely tucked up among old newspapers in a very spacious cage. We would like to thank Rudi for his patient and skilfull help in removing this rather unusual guest.   READ MORE: 8 Most dangerous snakes of the Lowveld
