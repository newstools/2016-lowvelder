MBOMBELA &#8211; A family who have two special-needs children are still short of funds to pay for an eye operation which has to be performed next week. Cyrus Potgieter (4) was born with ptosis, commonly known as &#8216;lazy-eye&#8217;.He had his first operation after he was born, and now has to have another procedure to lift his eyelid. He will be needing an operation every two years as he grows.Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit staff have raised R12 000 towards their plight, but the eye operation itself will cost R18 000. Cyrus&#8217; parents Mr Huey and Ms Petru Potgieter, explained that the operation has to be performed in Pretoria. His new glasses would cost another R4 000. &#8220;This might not be a fortune for some people, but it is for us. Even though both of us are working, we just make ends meet,&#8221; Huey said. &#8220;We are so thankful to Hi-Tech Security for trying to help us, a thousand blessings to all their staff,&#8221; Petru said.Additional aid for Cyrus has come in the form of Gerhard Lourens Attorneys, which helped the family set up a trust account which will be managed by the firm, free of charge. The couple&#8217;s other son, Xerxes (2), has Down&#8217;s syndrome. Dasha Foundation for disabled children, has offered him a place when he is old enough to go to school.&#8220;They said they will help arrange a payment plan for the fees,&#8221; Pertu said.
