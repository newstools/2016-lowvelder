MATSULU &#8211; An elephant that persistently broke out of the Kruger National Park was shot and killed and the meat given to the community for Christmas. Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) Senior manager, Mr Jan Muller, said that they had received a call from the local police about an elephant which kept escaping from the adjoining Kruger National Park.&#8220;He had already caused a lot of damage in the area and we found him close to a school. He was eating his way through a lot of the local communities crops.&#8221;The elephant seemed to have targeted the mielie crops in particular.Muller said the elephant had broken the fence and had kept entering the town over the last couple of days before Christmas at night.&#8220;He would go back during the day when he heard people. Once an elephant learns that there is an easy life outside the Park, he will continue to escape. So we are left with no alternative but to shoot him.&#8221;He said they cut the head off which included the tusks but had given the rest of the meat to the community. &#8220;They were extremely grateful for the meat a day before Christmas,&#8221; he said.SANParks spokesman, Mr William Mabaso, confirmed that the elephant had escaped from the Park.READ MORE: Man trampled by elephant in Kruger
