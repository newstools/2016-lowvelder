The team handed out more at the Petra Mission in Masoyi on Friday.Boden also spearheaded the local Blankets For Madiba campaign by challenging members of the community to show support by making knitted or crocheted blankets for the needy.Also read: Spreading love a blanket at a time Bags for Gogos was Boden&#8217;s brainchild. &#8220;After reading about a similar project happening in Cape Town and in California in the US, I decided to put out a request for pre-loved handbags and drew up a wish list of goodies needed to fill them,&#8221; she said.The initial aim was to get 30 bags donated, but when friends, family, churches, the Rotary Club and neighbours heard of the request, more than 120 bags were handed in, together with items to put in them.Every bag contained a pretty scarf, beads and an array of toiletries. Some had packets of sweets and some of the travel bags were filled with goodies specifically for men.Also read: Blankets continue to bring comfort &#8220;The aim of the project is to improve the dignity of gogos and elderly men, to give treats to folk who never get much acknowledgement. I am amazed and awestruck at just how generous people are. A few cash donations received were used to supplement the shortage of toiletries,&#8221; Boden said.She would love to continue the project in the years to come. &#8220;It feels good to work with a team that is always ready to assist society in appreciating the role played by the elderly. We wish to have a bigger one next year,&#8221; Boden concluded.
