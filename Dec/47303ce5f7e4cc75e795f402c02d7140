NGODWANA &#8211; The baby who was recently kidnapped by her mother&#8217;s family, was reunited with her paternal grandmother this week.Lowvelder reported on Tuesday how 14-year-old, Sannie* and her parents Daan* and Petro*, fled with Sannie&#8217;s 14-month-old baby, after the High Court granted custody of the baby to her paternal grandmother, Lea*.The family was found in Krugersdorp on Monday. They handed themselves over to the police. The family was transported back to Waterval Boven Police Station in the back of a police van.Lea* spoke to Lowvelder at her home in Ngodwana on Wednesday.&#8220;It was around midnight when they got to Waterval Boven. We had been waiting for them. They wouldn&#8217;t allow us to go into the police station. We could hear Daan and his family talking loudly inside the building,&#8221; she said.When she was handed the 14-month-old baby girl, she was wearing a dress appropriate for a three- to six-month-old baby and her pull-up nappy was two sizes too small, Lea said. According to Lea, the little girl was dirty, had a diaper rash, and a bruise just below her eye.Her legs are bowed, which may suggest she was left in a walking ring for long periods of time, not allowing her legs to grow straight.&#8220;We took her home, gave her a much-needed bath, dressed her in clothes that actually fit her, with a nappy that fits her, and gave her a bottle of milk. She did not fuss at all and fell asleep immediately,&#8221; Lea reported.*Pieter, the baby&#8217;s father, allegedly received threats from Daan.&#8220;We were just around the corner from the police station when Daan contacted me. He made threats, saying he will find another way to nail me. I keep every message and I record every call, he violated a protection order, and threatened me. My daughter will grow up in a safe environment, that is what matters to me,&#8221; Pieter said.Also see: Pregnant teen and parents flee with baby&#8220;I was extremely upset when I found out about Pieter&#8217;s relationship with Sannie. I was told he was dating a younger girl, but never knew how young. It was inappropriate, I was not raised that way, and I did not raise him that way. I would not trade my grandchild for the world,&#8221; Lea said.&#8220;I thought it was love. I was so stupid. Sannie wanted a baby. None of the adults in that house have jobs, none of the minors are old enough to work. My child-support payment was their only income,&#8221; said Pieter.Pieter added that the Department of Social Development (Dsd) had failed his child and the other minors in Daan and Petro&#8217;s home. When the court ruling was made, Pieter asked that the Dsd go to Sannie&#8217;s house and make sure that they did not leave.A family advocate, Mr Francois Rawlinson, made a recommendation that all the minors in Daan and Petro&#8217;s care be removed, as it appears that their youngest daughter is sexually active at the age 11 already. This information came up in court.Sannie is pregnant again and engaged to be married to her second child&#8217;s father.The baby appears to be skittish, as everything is new around her, but she seems to be adjusting well.&#8220;As you can see, she clings to her ouma. When she is around, only baby TV channels are allowed. She plays with the dog and with lots of toys, and has a healthy appetite too. We have enrolled her in a preprimary school&#8217;s baby class. This morning was her first day,&#8221; said Lea.A case had been opened against Sannie and her parents, although Lowvelder was not been able to confirm if they have been charged with anything yet.Also see: Crime stats for Mpumalanga*Aliases are used to protect the identities of the underage children involved.
