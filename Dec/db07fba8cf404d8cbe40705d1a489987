Surging international petroleum prices are expected to hit South Africans hard at the pumps in January. This is the Automibile Association s (AA) opinion, which was commenting on unaudited mid-month fuel price data that was released by the Central Energy Fund (CEF).&#8220;Saudi Arabia has indicated that its crude oil production cuts may go beyond those proposed in November,&#8221; the AA said. &#8220;There are also signals that non-OPEC members may voluntarily decrease production, which has the potential to further bolster international petroleum prices.&#8221;READ MORE: Save fuel the smart wayA strong appreciation in oil prices was shown in the first fortnight of December, however, the Rand remained volatile against the US dollar. Judging by the current data, the projected increase in fuel by the end of December will be around 27 cents for a litre of petrol, 21 cents for diesel and 28 cents for illuminating paraffin. According to the AA, the impact of production cuts was by no means factored into current oil prices.&#8220;If the oil-producing countries adhere to the proposed production cuts, oil prices are likely to strengthen until demand and production move back into equilibrium. Even a stronger Rand could be overpowered by a sharp climb in the oil price, potentially meaning a succession of fuel price hikes which could impact the economy strongly over the next few months.&#8221; the AA said.READ MORE: The real price of fuel in South AfricaPrivate motorists are warned to review their commuting patterns and energy use and consider alternatives to single-occupant vehicle use, such as car-pooling or public transport. The AA added that the rise in fuel prices was also an incentive for corporate delivery fleets to re-assess their vehicle selections and routing schedules in order to maximize fuel-efficiency.&#8220;Mitigation will be the key strategy against prolonged fuel price rises,&#8221; the Association concluded.
