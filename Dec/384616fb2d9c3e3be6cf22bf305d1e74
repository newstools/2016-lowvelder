MBOMBELA &#8211; The premier, Mr David Mabuza, answered questions by MPLs only once in the legislature this year. He has since embarked on a trip to Russia with top officials from his cabinet on a &#8220;fact-finding mission&#8221;.While the Legislature Handbook does not prescribe how many times he must have an oral reply session to questions, opposition parties are dissatisfied with his performance.Mabuza appeared before the house on May 31 where he gave verbal responses to eight questions on the list of 40. Where the MPL posing a question is not present, he can respond in writing. According to the rules, he is supposed to respond to written questions within 10 days.Also read: Provincial ANC keen to back Mabuza for top spot According to DA MPL Mr James Masango, Mabuza gave an oral response to questions only once.&#8220;Out of the 48 questions presented to the premier in advance, he only answered eight.

He also claimed Shongwe was shielding the premier from accounting to the house.&#8220;It is his job to answer our questions but that&#8217;s not happening.
