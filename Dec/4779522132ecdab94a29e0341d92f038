MBOMBELA &#8211; People often don&#8217;t talk about their depression, yet it affects all aspects of the lives daily. One Lowveld resident, who requested to remain anonymous, told Lowvelder she chose to share her experience of mental health issues in the hope of making more people aware of these patients&#8217; struggles.She was hospitalised after suffering panic attacks. She had been taking medication for depression prior to the attacks. &#8220;The depression started raising its head after I used diet pills as a student,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;After taking the medication for two years, I went to live with a relative who has her own mental health problems,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Due to various reasons, I felt that I could not live with her anymore and I left home,&#8221; she said.&#8221;I stayed with friends, but after four days I realised I couldn&#8217;t stay there either.&#8221;&nbsp;
