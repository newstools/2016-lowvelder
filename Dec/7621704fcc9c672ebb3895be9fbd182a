SKUKUZA &#8211; The launch of the SANParks Persons with Disabilities Forum on December 3, which was International Day of People with Disabilities, was a colourful occasion. A variety of speakers gave solutions to actively promote rights in the workplace.The forum was inaugurated by SANParks head of human capital, Ms Philiswa Mahlangu, who officiated on behalf of management.In concluding the day, she, her team and employees signed a charter for the rights of persons with disabilities working for SANParks.The forum will also support disabled tourists who visit parks.&#8220;It is a reality that people living with disabilities are still being discriminated against in some areas of our society, including in the workplace. Some people are born with a disability. Some get sick or have an accident that results in a disability while others develop disabilities as they age or at some point in their lives. SANParks strives to play a part in breaking down these barriers to ensure that the stigma or perception attached to disabilities diminishes.We therefore hope that this launch will increase awareness, understanding and improve attitudes towards the inclusion and participation of people with disabilities,&#8221; said Mahlangu.Mr Glenn Phillips, managing executive of the Kruger National Park (KNP), said that the management of the KNP will assist employees.&#8220;Wherever you want to go in your careers, we will support you. We need to create a destination for all. If we all work together God&#8217;s love will help us deliver what we have to,&#8221; he said.One of SANParks&#8217; objectives is to increase the representation of people living with disabilities in its workforce from the current 1,7 per cent to 2 per cent by the end of the 2016/17 financial year.Mr Du Toit Nkambule from the Mpumalanga Department of Social Development, said the department is committed to assist the forum, especially in preparing policy documents.&#8220;We have more than 50 activities for people with disabilities in the province and will include the forum in that programme,&#8221; explained Nkambule.Various technological aids that can help people with disabilities to manage their everyday lives were demonstrated like a pair of specially adapted glasses that helps the partially sighted (See gallery).With the KNFB reader, partially-sighted people can have a newspaper or book read to them by a text-recognition programme.For Mr Patrick Mathlawhane, chairman of Disabled People of South Africa (DPSA), it was important to point out that one of the roles of the SANParks forum can fulfil would be to level the playing field.&#8220;We can participate equally. The forum must not fail us. We can do whatever we want to do, as long as we get the support we need,&#8221; said Mathlawhane.SANParks reached a &#8220;huge&#8221; milestone said Mr Thabang Magogo of the Gender Commission.He warned however that the forum should not only concentrate on events and celebrations.&#8220;A forum such as this has a huge role to play with policy development to ensure organisational change. The rights of people with disabilities must be mainstreamed. Our voices must be heard in all forums,&#8221; said Magogo.Mr Danie Marais, programme manager of the National Council for Persons with Physical Disabilities, informed the audience that the theme for next year&#8217;s Casual Day will be, &#8220;Celebrate diversity with persons with disabilities,&#8221; and invited all stakeholders to be part of this and the activities of the council.&#8220;Let&#8217;s take hands and move forward together,&#8221; said Marais.
