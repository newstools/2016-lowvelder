MBOMBELA &#8211; Two of the five Nelspruit Golf Club (NGC) members involved in an altercation on October 15, were suspended on Monday. Both were found guilty at the recent disciplinary inquiry held by the club on November 25.A criminal case was also opened by 19-year-old golfer, Mr Jabulane Mabilane. He claimed that four men were present when he was allegedly beaten up on the golf course.Mabilane was found to have shown &#8220;behaviour unbecoming of a member in that (he) acted in an improper or unsportsmanlike manner&#8221; and guilty of &#8220;bringing the club into disrepute in that (he) acted prejudicially to the interest and reputation of NGC&#8221;.The other man, who cannot be named due to the outstanding criminal complaint, was also found guilty of &#8220;bringing the club into disrepute in that (he) acted prejudicially to the interest and reputation of NGC&#8221;.The other three were cleared. All five were provisionally suspended after the incident, pending the outcome of the inquiry. It was chaired by Mr Adriaan Smuts and his findings were announced on Monday afternoon.Both Mabilane and the other man were suspended from the club for 18 months. These sanctions were suspended for two years.Also read: Golf assault inquiry postponed yet againMabilane told Lowvelder soon after the incident that he was practicing on the seventh green when a four-ball, playing the sixth hole, said he was not allowed to do so.They also asked if he was a member of the club. He then approached the group of men. &#8220;They told me that the fly of my trousers was open and that I should keep quiet. I said if everyone else is practicing and I am not allowed to, it seems the only difference is that I am black, then that is racism,&#8221; he said.Mabilane said the next thing he knew, one of the men grabbed him by the shirt and punched him twice in the right eye. In his judgment, Smuts made it clear that he was appalled by the behaviour of the two members.He found that Mabilane had exaggerated the facts of the matter, overstated others and seriously contradicted himself on a range of issues. The judgement states that Mabilane &#8220;was one of the worst witnesses (the chairman had) ever encountered in (his) 40 years of practise&#8221;.It also says that Mabilane was not authorised to be on the course on the day in question as a competition was underway, although he was not in any way interfering with the play.It adds that Mabilane &#8220;completely overreacted when he approached the four-ball&#8221; and his conduct should have been prevented by a complaint to club officials instead.&#8220;Although the incident was labelled a racist attack, the only person to refer to race was indeed the first respondent (Mabilane) and nobody else,&#8221; it reads.The other man was found to have made the matter worse by telling Mabilane that his fly was open instead of defusing the situation. There was no imminent attack on him and even if there was, he overstepped the boundaries of self-defence by slapping and hitting Mabilane, Smuts found.&#8220;It is clear that he was aggravated by (Mabilane) and elected to hit him instead of taking other evasive actions.&#8221;A press statement released by NGC reads, &#8220;We acknowledge that the club is a family friendly environment and all persons should observe proper etiquette on and off the course.Also see: PREVIEW: Golfer beaten up on Nelspruit golf courseManagement will not hesitate to investigate and take action on persons not complying with the club&#8217;s values.&#8221; According to police spokesman, Sgt Gerald Sedibe, the case which Mabilane opened with the SAPS has been sent to the public prosecutor for a second time for a decision
