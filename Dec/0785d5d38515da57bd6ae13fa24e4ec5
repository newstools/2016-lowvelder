MBOMBELA- The NG Kerk Suid in Ehmke Street hosted the Day of the Covenant festival last Thursday and Friday. Diederick Scholtz, chairman of the Nelspruit Geloftefees committee, told Lowvelder that all the sister churches in Mbombela have been apart of this tradition for over fifty years. &#8220;My father was on this committee, and it had been going on even before he joined.All the churches in the city come together every year for this occasion, to share our heritage and culture with our children,&#8221; said Scholtz.On December 15 the members of all the churches were invited to enjoy a social gathering, where the kids could indulge in &#8216;boeresport&#8217; games and eat some traditional Afrikaner food. A film is shown to the children about the Battle of Blood River, and they are told about how the moon will light up the Voortrekker Monument at midnight.&#8220;We vowed that December 16 would be a Sabbath, and so we had a church service in the morning. Ds Eksteen Botes from the Reformed Church, led the service this year as we choose someone from a different church every year,&#8221; said Diederick, &#8220;We are proud of our culture and it is important that our children know our history.&#8221;Also see: Teen in dire need of funds
