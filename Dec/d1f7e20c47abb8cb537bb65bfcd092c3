MBOMBELA &#8211; Ms Cordelia M ller was given a Baby Browning 6.35mm pistol by her father in 1997. It was to be carried with her when she went cycling.&#8220;It fit perfectly into my cycling shirt and was meant for self-defense when I was riding alone. But a year later, it was stolen along with my handbag out of my car. I opened a case at Nelspruit Police Station and I thought that was the end of it,&#8221; M ller explained.In the meantime, her father cancelled his post box address at Schagen Post Office and started using his business one for all correspondence.Also read: BREAKING NEWS: Man arrested for possession of Rhino hornIt was two years ago when he passed away, that M ller&#8217;s mother reapplied for an address at the same post office. She just so happened to be allocated the same post box that she and her husband had previously accessed.&#8220;That is the most interesting part about this story. If my mother hadn&#8217;t been given the same postal address, I would never have received the letter from KaNyamazane Police Station to inform me that my gun had been found,&#8221; M ller said. She still does not quite believe her own story.&#8220;It is an absolute coincidence. All my details have changed since 1998; my surname, cellphone number, everything.&#8221;She was also incredibly impressed by Const Selby Magabula, who went out of his way to be of service.&#8220;When I arrived at the station to follow-up on the letter, I didn&#8217;t expect anything. I just wanted to find out what the process was. The constable said I would need R70 for a temporary licence. I didn&#8217;t have any cash on me but explained that I would come back the following day,&#8221; M ller said.Also read: No tourists involved in staged robbery in KrugerMagabula, however, offered to lend her the money to get the process started immediately. She paid him back when she went to collect the gun. M ller also asked whether it was clean and if it had been given a ballistic test.&#8220;I was reassured that no crimes had been committed with my gun, which was a relief. It is damaged though and I will need to get it fixed and tested. Then, I will need to look at getting a certificate of competency.&#8221;Lowvelder is aware of two similar cases where gun owners had their weapons stolen many years ago and have recently been contacted to pick them up at different police stations in the region. One woman had her gun stolen 30 years ago.
