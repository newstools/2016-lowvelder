MBOMBELA &#8211; A new eye-tracking device could open a world of possibilities for nine-year-old Annerie Oosthuyzen and her family, as it would allow her to &#8220;speak&#8221; with her eyes. Annerie suffers from severe spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, which means that all four of her limbs are equally affected.She is unable to speak or move from one place to another unaided. Tobii Technology has led the charge for eye-tracking and gaze-interaction technology for individuals who are nonverbal and with limited ability to physically interact. Annerie would operate the device with her eyes and use it as a tool for communication. Depending on the model, it could cost anywhere from R130 000 to R200 000.
