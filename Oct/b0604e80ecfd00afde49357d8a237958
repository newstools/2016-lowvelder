BADPLAAS &#8211; Almost 50 Lowveld senior citizens enjoyed the annual fun-filled holiday at a Rotary-owned resort last week. For many it is their only holiday and offers the chance to make friends and enjoy company outside their homes.With the famous hot-water springs only 500 metres away and daily trips to the hydro spa, the seniors could relax in the heated swimming pool and Jacuzzi, before returning for an afternoon of rest and recreation.Those taking part had to contribute to the cost of the accommodation, but the whole week, which included three meals a day and many outings, was subsidised by the Rotary Club of White River.Current organisers, Rob and June Sykes, said the club reserves the whole resort for a week each year. It is known as SWEMB, an acronym of the founding Rotary clubs of Springs, Witbank, Ermelo, Middelburg and Bethel.&#8220;Rotary offers a very inexpensive holiday at the 60-bedroom property,&#8221; explained Rob, who has been running the event with June for the past four years.&#8220;Everyone is transported and looked after for the whole week with a daily programme of activities, including a trip to the Cradle of Life.&#8220;We also arrange plenty of entertainment with bingo, talent contests, singalongs and board games. The highlight of the week is usually the fancy dress party and this year the theme was &#8216;Back to School&#8217;.&#8221;June carries out all the admin work, from producing the advertisements, contacting potential holidaymakers to producing event programmes and badges. Last year her significant contribution was recognised and she received Rotary International&#8217;s highest commendation, the Paul Harris Fellowship.&#8220;It is very satisfying to ensure that many of the most deserving in the community have a great time,&#8221; said June.&#8220;Our club provides the cost of the transport and some food and the shared rooms, which cost between R1 800 and R2 300 for the week, are also subsidised.&#8221;&nbsp;
