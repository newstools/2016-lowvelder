MBOMBELA &#8211; The theme for the evening was the &#8220;enchanted forest&#8221; and the pupils looked nothing short of breathtaking. They arrived in vehicles ranging from limousines to ambulances.Dinner was a tantalising three-course meal presented by Food Fundi, with an array of coffees at the bistro to conclude a fantastic event. Curro Nelspruit&#8217;s matric dance definitely was an enchanted event, sending off the class of 2016 in style.
