WHITE RIVER &#8211; Rabid animals are believed to be on the loose in the Lowveld. The White River SPCA is locked in a race against time to find the dogs that were recently bitten by a rabies-infected canine.It came to the SPCA&#8217;s attention when an Africanis was dropped off at its holding kennels on October 2. According to an anonymous note attached to the dog, its owner decided to do away with it after it had attacked other dogs. &#8220;I fear that she may bite my child. Sorry,&#8221; the paper read and indicated that the dog&#8217;s name was Roxy.The SPCA arranged for the dog to be put down. Samples of its brain were sent for testing and, on October 10, it was confirmed that it had been infected with rabies. Because the dog had bitten an unknown number of canines, there is now a possibility that other rabid dogs are roaming free in White River.In an attempt to cordon off the risk area, the SPCA urged community members to come forward if their dogs had been bitten. It also requested Roxy&#8217;s owner to come forward. A week later, the organisation had not received any information that could pinpoint the dog&#8217;s location before it was dropped off at the holding kennels, representative Ms Annemarie van der Westhuizen said.&#8220;This means we may have a horrific situation on our hands,&#8221; said Ms Estelle de Villiers. &#8220;We know that she had bitten other dogs, but we do not know where or which ones. Rabies is highly infectious and very dangerous.&#8221;Also read: Animal abuse claims investigated in Mozambique Veterinarian, Dr Delarey Brugman, explained that infected persons and animals must be treated urgently. &#8220;After a human or animal has been bitten by a rabid dog, the incubation period sets in,&#8221; he said. This period typically ranges from one to three months. &#8220;In this time, the virus migrates through the nervous system. Clinical symptoms present themself as soon as it reaches the infected animal or person&#8217;s spinal chord or brain,&#8221; he said. Brugman took a deep breath and said upon exhaling, &#8220;And then it is over.&#8221;Watch what happens to a rabies infected human:&nbsp;A rabid dog was also captured by the Barberton SPCA on October 1. Trainee inspector, Mr Niek van Dyk, said he was summoned to Katanga. &#8220;The canine was fine the one day and the next he became very aggressive. When the owner tried to capture him, he was bitten and the dog ran off towards Mountain View School. That is where I captured him.&#8221;Also read: Meet the ghosts of the Lowveld The dog was put down and the state vet confirmed a case of rabies. Van Dyk said a young child was also bitten, but both victims have received treatment.According to the vet, it was the first case of rabies in the area in 15 years. It was not clear whether the dog had bitten any other animals or people, but the secretary, Ms Marlies Liebenberg said they had received no reports of similar incidents.Yet, De Villiers explained that animals do not have to be bitten to be infected. &#8220;If it comes into contact with the saliva of a rabid dog, it can be infected. This could easily lead to a rabies breakout. We appeal to owners to have their canines tested,&#8221; she said.Symptoms indicative of rabies in dogs include fever, seizures and paralysis, the eating of foreign substances and an inability to swallow. They may act overly aggressive, bark differently and salivate excessively.&#8220;If you notice any bite marks on your dog, if your dog was interacting with strange dogs or you notice any strange behaviour in yours, it could be infected,&#8221; Van Niekerk said. De Villiers stated that if a resident&#8217;s canine has not been vaccinated within the past 12 months and displays strange or aggressive behaviour, he or she must report it to the state or local vet.Residents who do not report it and get immediate veterinary attention for their animal, could be held responsible for culpable homicide should any human die after coming into contact with the dog, she cautioned. The disease can be transmitted by any warm-blooded animal, which means all pets should be monitored.According to Brugman, treatment to counter rabies can be successfully administered during the incubation period. &#8220;That is why we need information on where this dog was and who and what it may have bitten, urgently,&#8221; he said.Owners are compelled by law (Animals Diseases Act 35 of 1984) to ensure that their canines and cats are vaccinated against rabies at the age of three months, followed by a second vaccination more than 30 days later and less than nine months after the first, and annually thereafter.Van der Westhuizen requested Roxy&#8217;s previous owner, or anyone with information on the dog, to come forward as a matter of urgency. &#8220;Each day that passes without us receiving more information on the dog increases the scope of this crisis,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We want Roxy&#8217;s owner to know that she will not get into trouble for reporting the case. We just really need her help, to help the community,&#8221; she said. This week is rabies vaccination week in Barberton.
