MBOMBELA &#8211; A prosecutor in the regional Magistrate&#8217;s Court was arrested on Friday on charges of defeating the ends of justice and fraud. According to provincial Hawks spokesman Capt Dineo Sekgotodi, Mr Sijoyi Robert Ndlovu (45) was taken into custody at 10:35 at Regional Court 1.He appeared in another courtroom later that day. He was charged with two counts of fraud and defeating the ends of justice. &#8220;It is alleged that during July 2015, a criminal gang involved in a series of aggravating house robberies around Pienaar, Mbombela and Ngodwana, appeared in the court of law.&#8221;She said Ndlovu was the public prosecutor assigned to their cases. The cases were postponed for formal bail application as the investigating officials were opposed to the accused being granted bail. Later the investigation officials learned that the prosecutor had informed the court that the accused were not properly linked to the case and that the state&#8217;s case against them was weak.&#8220;These were serious contraventions of the procedure,&#8221; Sekgotodi said. &#8220;The North Gauteng director of public prosecutions later decided to charge the suspects.&#8221; She said Ndlovu is not being charged with extortion. Ndlovu has been released on a warning.His case has been postponed until November 16 for him to obtain legal representation. Provincial National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesman, Ms Monica Nyuswa, said there was an internal disciplinary processes that were pending against the prosecutor regarding the matter.She said there had been formal complaints about the work ethic of Ndlovu which was part of the procedures.Read more here: Luxembourg prosecutor appeals LuxLeaks tax scandal verdicts
