MBOMBELA &#8211; The University of Mpumalanga held its first annual lecture on ethical and moral leadership on Tuesday.The initiative, sponsored by the Archbishop Thabo Makgoba Development Trust, was established to strengthen the moral compasses of young leaders to ensure that they lead with honourable intentions and integrity.This was explained by the university&#8217;s vice-chancellor, Prof Thoko Mayekiso, during her welcoming address.Mayekiso said the lecture was aimed a great deal at the #FeesMustFall leadership members, some of whom were in attendance.The #FeesMustFall campaign has seen a number of universities close their campuses in response to violence by protesters against fees, after minister for higher education, Dr Blade Mzimande, announced that increases for 2017 would be capped at eight per cent. Each institution could decide by how much their tuition would increase. Yet, calm was restored at the University of Mpumalanga on October 11 after classes had been suspended for seven days.Prof John Shongwe, the university&#8217;s coordinator of stakeholder liaisons, introduced Prof Sipho Seepe, a highly qualified teacher with South African and international experience. Seepe said leadership was about change.Also read: Things we can appreciate from a post-1994 South Africa He stated that leaders should never act out of personal vendettas, but rather for the greater good. Seepe elaborated on the evils black leaders endured during apartheid.&#8220;Yet they did not lead for the wrong reasons. They addressed what needed to be addressed &#8211; structural challenges,&#8221; he said. Seepe named Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo.&#8220;They galvanised action,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you look at leaders, they are not defined by how much they hated who.&#8220;They are defined by how they took a systemic approach to handle the issues of their times.&#8221;Also read: UMP works towards solving students&#8217; problems He referred to challenges experienced by the students of the &#8217;70s, &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. He asked, &#8220;If they didn&#8217;t break windows in expressing their dissatisfaction, why is it happening today?&#8221; Seepe asked what it was that caused the worst in people to come forth, although we had attained democracy.He challenged academics and students to ask similar thought-provoking questions.He highlighted the gift of freedom that current students are enjoying. &#8220;We have so much to be thankful for. We should seek to uplift our communities as a whole and not to vindicate those who wronged us as individuals,&#8221; he said.Seepe then quoted Saint Francis of Assisi, &#8220;Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace.&#8220;Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy.&#8221;
