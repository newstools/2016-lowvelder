MBOMBELA &#8211; A delightful spring day dawned sunny and fair as Lowveld High School welcomed the heat with a family fun day recently.They packed out brightly coloured jumping castles with the incorporated cooling water slides and a racy mechanical bull on the school&#8217;s soccer field.The event was initially scheduled to take place a week prior but was postponed due to the rain. It resulted in a relatively poor turnout, but the day was full of laughter.Many children came out to ride the water slides and brave the bull, splash about in the pools, and have temporary tattoos done by Cecilia, a popular pastime by all accounts.Papa Smurf, proudly represented by Noah Phiri, was on hand to entertain the little ones. A few people brought their dogs along to enjoy the day and the glorious Lowveld sunshine.Dogs, Shaka and Duke thought the kiddies splash pool at the base of the water slide was meant especially for them to cool off. They vied for space along with Daniel de Klerk and his mother, both having a field day.Although initially a quieter day than was anticipated by the organisers, many children &#8211; and parents &#8211; came to enjoy the school&#8217;s day of fun and games, and had a fabulous time enjoying the warm weather, sunshine and fun on offer.
