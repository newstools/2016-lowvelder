MBOMBELA &#8211; Ms Donna McCallum, also known as the Fairy Godmother, says many people need to shift their mindset when it comes to money and wealth.&#8220;Many people feel absolute terror about being a wealthy person. They believe that wealth comes at some kind of cost,&#8221; she told the audience at her recent seminar to promote her nine-week online Money Magic course at Emnotweni.Also read: Be sure of what you want and chase it to succeedThe three-hour session was a discussion about people&#8217;s relationship with money and how it could be improved. According to McCallum, this country is the most indebted in the world. &#8220;Eighty-six per cent of adults in South Africa have consumer debt,&#8221; she said.According to her, the reason many South Africans do not have a good relationship with their finances, is a lack of education.&#8220;Without real education about money, your chances of getting and keeping any, are slim,&#8221; she said.People get into debt because they are still on a superficial level when dealing with money.&#8221;She believed there was a direct link between people&#8217;s thoughts and the results in their lives. &#8220;What is giving you those thoughts? Where do they come from?&#8221; she asked her audience.Beliefs, culture, experiences, parents, role models and the media were some of the suggestions.&#8220;Beliefs are not the truth; they are simply a perception. The mind believes it is the truth because it sees it everywhere. We are told money is evil from a young age, it is drummed into us. If you believe something is evil, it will stay away from you,&#8221; McCallum said.She suggested using what she calls &#8220;af-for-mations&#8221; to retrain the brain to think about money and wealth differently, or any aspect of one&#8217;s life.&#8220;Af-for-mations&#8221; are positive questions which always start with a &#8220;why&#8221;.&#8220;Keep throwing out the question, every day, many times a day if necessary. Why have I created a business I love? Why has my stream of abundance become a mighty river?&#8221; McCallum encouraged. &#8220;If it feels good, use it.&#8221;Also read: Four ways to secure a financially sound future as a womanOne woman jokingly suggested, &#8220;Why am I so unbelievably thin?&#8221; which had everyone in the room laughing. The Fairy Godmother also spoke of her goals for financial freedom.My view about that is doing whatever I want, whenever I want with whomever I want. And in three years, I will never have to work for money again because money will work for me,&#8221; she concluded.For more information about the Fairy Godmother visit her website at www.fairygodmotherinc.com.
