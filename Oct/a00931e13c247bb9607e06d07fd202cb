MBOMBELA &#8211; There is hope for the Khoisan diaspora in the Lowveld, following the formation of a council aimed at reviving the culture and heritage of the population.The Lowveld KhoiSan Council (LKC) was formed by concerned Khoisan/Bushmen inhabitants in the region who felt they had been robbed of their identity by being classified as coloured. The council said it wanted to work with government to address the rights of this population.One of the council members, David Okki Petersen, told Lowvelder that describing Khoisan people as coloured was a way of depriving them of their identity.&#8220;The term &#8216;coloured&#8217; was first used by the colonial regime after it failed to wipe us out when it dispossessed us of our land. We are not coloured,&#8221; Petersen said.According to him they will set up a database to record all the people belonging to the tribes. These are the Griqua, Namas, Korawas, Bushmen and Cape Khoi.&#8220;Everyone in the community who identifies with their Khoisan-descendant identity and heritage, is invited to be a part of the process,&#8221; he added.According to Petersen, the term did not have meaning and made them feel as though they did not belong anywhere.He added that the many rocks with Bushmen paintings in the province had proved they have roots in Mpumalanga.The council also plans to advocate the government to allow people to lodge claims on land lost prior to the Land Act of 1913 coming into effect.&#8220;Many of us lost our land prior to 1913 and The Constitution doesn&#8217;t cater for our demand to be able to claim for the land we lost to the Dutch colonisers,&#8221; he said.The socio-economic conditions of Khoisans also need to be addressed across the country. &#8220;We believe that we are overlooked when it comes to employment and business opportunities because there is no census that counts our population,&#8221; said Petersen.LKC is an offshoot of the National Reference Group set up by the minister of rural development and land reform, Gugile Nkwinti. It aims to help government find ways to assist the population to find its feet, especially in terms of development.&#8220;We are a part of the national agenda that is fighting to revive the culture and heritage of the Khoisan people,&#8221; Petersen concluded.The council&#8217;s next meeting will be held at the Nelsville Community Centre at 18:30 on November 10.
