MBOMBELA &#8211; Spokesman for the department, Mr Jasper Zwane, was speaking in reference to the memorandum of demands handed over to the MEC, Ms Reginah Mhaule by the union on September 29.Thousands of protesters marched to the legislature from the showground and other parts of the city to present the memorandum to the MEC and the Office of the Premier.&#8220;Today we are telling the MEC to maintain the current number of teaching posts. Secondly, we want the moratorium placed on the filling of vacant posts, to be lifted with immediate effect,&#8221; Mr Walter Hlaise, provincial secretary for Sadtu, told Lowvelder.Also read: Teachers threaten to march againHlaise was referring to the department&#8217;s alleged intention to cut teaching posts from the current 32 637 to 31 206 and the moratorium on the filling of posts which would result in close to 1 500 vacancies in its offices and 100 in general-worker posts.Zwane said it was a misunderstanding and that the cutting of education posts was more of a proposal than a decision. He added that the matter had been discussed at a meeting between the respective parties on October 11.&#8220;As things stand, teachers are back in class and learning is continuing. Our main goal at this stage is to ensure schools and pupils are ready for the final exams,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We are happy we are able to engage with the union. It is important for us to continue doing so.&#8221;Also see: WATCH: Thousands march over education grievances
