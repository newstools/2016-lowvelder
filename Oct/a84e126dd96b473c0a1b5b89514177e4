MBOMBELA &#8211; Headlines of farm attacks initially evoke sympathy, but the families affected by them are soon forgotten while their lives are often changed forever. One such victim, Mr Mike van Zweel Jr (33), was shot and robbed by four unknown suspects at his home on a farmstead at Alkmaar on May 21, 2015.&#8220;When it first happens and your story is on the front page of Lowvelder, everyone is concerned about you and your family.
