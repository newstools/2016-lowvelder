MBOMBELA &#8211; A Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit response officer has received a top national award. Mr Martin van Staden was honoured in Johannesburg on Saturday by the Security Industry Alliance with its top platinum award for going beyond the call of duty.More than 350 guests attended the event from all over the country to honour security officers who had made a difference. Van Staden received the award for his team&#8217;s capture of the so-called perfume gang on April 24. The team comprised Mr Brendan Beukes, Mr David Sekwela, Mr Danie Erasmus and Mr Eugene Fourie. The gang was so named for allegedly stealing a large amount of perfume from a pharmacy. Van Staden told Lowvelder how the arrest came about.&#8220;I got a call-out about an alarm going off at Crossing Centre. As I came through the slipway, I saw a Mazda 3 parked next to another sedan.&#8221; He approached the five men who were loading bags into the vehicles. A shoot-out ensued. Van Staden shot at, and managed to hit one of the vehicle&#8217;s tyres. A number of nearby store windows were damaged, but no one was injured.Van Staden called his Rapid Response Unit for backup. The suspects fled via the R40 in the direction of Barberton, with the security officers in hot pursuit. &#8220;I managed to shoot the one vehicle&#8217;s radiator. Water started spilling out,&#8221; Van Staden recalled. By the time they had reached the first hairpin bend, the other car&#8217;s flat tyre had come off the rim. Both sedans left the road before the pass, and the high-speed chase came to an end. The police arrived shortly afterwards.All five suspects were arrested at the scene. Most of the stolen goods were recovered. Van Staden said after the incident, the management at Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit nominated the team for the award. He could not believe it when his name was called out at the ceremony. &#8220;It was a team effort. I am very grateful for the bravery of our team.&#8221; Each of the suspects has been denied bail. Their court case is set to continue on December 2.Read more here : Perfume gang caught in the act&nbsp;
