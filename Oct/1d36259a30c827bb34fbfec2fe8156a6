Master of ceremonies for the three days, Marc Paterson, did an excellent job of keeping guests informed of the latest happenings and reminding them to stay hydrated on what were some of the summer&#8217;s hottest days so far.The directional tree felling and chainsaw cross-cutting attracted large crowds to the beer tent where they could grab ice-cold refreshments and watch proceedings from the comfort of the shade.Old-hand chainsaw operator Marius Taljard, was spot on in the Husqvarna directional tree-felling competition and managed to hit the flag directly, winning the Agfo Expo Trophy. The Rudamans team beat the MTO Group in the tug-of-war after a fiercely contested competition.Eleven-year-old Eugene Engelbrecht showed he was the dung deal when he won the &#8220;bokdrolspoeg&#8221; competition, demonstrating rather impressive distance spitting.Another highlight was the two Thrush firefighting aircraft which demonstrated a water drop for the expo crowds. Pilots Rob Taylor and Riaan Foley flew the planes, which carry up to 1 500 litres of water each, over the arena.Also read: First-ever book festival has something for allAccording to Andre Scheepers of the Lowveld and Escarpment Fire Protection Association (Lefpa), the aircraft were contracted to the organisation by Orsmond Aviation in Bethlehem from May to October.They are used by Lefpa for firefighting, specifically in the forestry industry.
