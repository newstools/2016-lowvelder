WHITE RIVER &#8211; An urgent message doing the rounds that residents should stop using the municipal water supply for drinking has been deemed a hoax by the municipality.The WhatsApp and Facebook messages recommended that all water be boiled after Ampath and Sembcorp Silulumanzi (SS) allegedly found traces of the Rotavirus, E. coli and Shigella dysenteriae in the drinking water.Spokesman for the municipality, Mr Joseph Ngala, said the water was clean. We don t know who is spreading the message. We have gone as far as to have SS test the raw water. They found nothing untoward. As far as we know there is no problem with our drinking water.
