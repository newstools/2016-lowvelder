LOW&#8217;S CREEK &#8211; The executive mayor of City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) has promised to tackle the grievances aired by the community, after police fired rubber bullets at protesters on Sunday.Cllr Sibusiso Mathonsi spoke to the masses about their grievances yesterday morning when they continued a service-delivery protest which started on Sunday night. Angered citizens barricaded the R38 between Low&#8217;s Creek and Kaapmuiden with rocks and trees. They claim they have received no services from CMLM for 15 years, only empty promises.According to police spokesman Sgt Gerald Sedibe, the protesters threw rocks and damaged a police vehicle on Sunday night. &#8220;We had to use rubber bullets and smoke grenades on the crowd to control the situation.&#8221;The protest was due to the community&#8217;s grievances over a lack of electricity and water in the area. &#8220;We have been promised (water and electricity) for nearly 15 years and still nothing,&#8221; a member of the community told Lowvelder on the scene. &#8220;They keep giving us empty promises.&#8221;According to him, the community was happy that the mayor had come to address them personally to hear their grievances. &#8220;We will now see what happens.&#8221; CMLM spokesman, Mr Joseph Ngala said the municipality would attend to these issues. &#8220;We are now addressing their challenges and will respond when we have addressed their issues.&#8221; Mathonsi promised to deal with their issues and to return with answers in two weeks. The protest dispersed peacefully.Read more here: New mayor wants to put the people first
