CAPE TOWN &#8211; In an effort to support the heroes from the K 9 Unit of the Kruger National Park Janine Avery from African Geographic put together a Dog Food Drive for the love of dogs and rhinos, to try and get the public to put their money behind the mouths of Kruger s canines.Through the donation of dog food she thought that we as the public, could channel some of our anger, fatigue, and feelings of helplessness, into something tangible.&#8220;By the simple act of providing food for the rhino dogs other vital funding can be spent on other necessary and innovative ways of protecting our rhinos,&#8221; said Avery.People came from around South Africa to lend their hands with drop-off points, transport, collections and monetary donations. In total over 240 bags were collected and funded through donations, to the equivelant of R140,000 worth of food for the dogs.&#8220;A fantastic showing that should go towards feeding all the working dogs in the park for over half the year&#8221; said Avery.Some notable mentions include Yuppiepet for graciously opening up a space on their website as an online donation portal, BKB Louwid for donating a portion of the money raised at their recent auction to the cause to the tune of R10,000, Chameleon Books for holding a garden party and book sale in the name of the canine unit, Shinzelle Safaris, Ullman Sails, and Barloworld Toyota for transport of the food, MAKRO Nelspruit and their customers whose contributions counted up to a fantastic total of R14,200, Twisted Whiskers Pet Deli &amp; Spa for being the drop-off point with the most bags a total of 35, Hills Pet Nutrition for their vital and ongoing support of the dogs, the SANParks Honorary Rangers for everything they do to protect our national parks and the species that call them home, and above all every person, vet and business that opened up their arms to serve as drop-off points, spread the word, or get involved with making a donation or dropping off a bag.To continue to show support for the anti-poaching canines of Kruger email knpk9unit@gmail.com.Wishlists are available for those wishing to contribute to the needs of the centre as are the bank details for anyone wishing to make a monetary donation, every little bit goes directly to the activities on the ground and the support of these dogs, their handlers, the rangers and to saving our rhinos.&nbsp;&nbsp;
