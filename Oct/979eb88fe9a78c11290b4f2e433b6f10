MBOMBELA &#8211; Being found with heroin worth R50 million has been deemed &#8220;possession&#8221; and the punishment for this set at five years in prison or a R50 000 fine. This was the penalty imposed on Isaac Mtashini after he pleaded guilty to a charge of drug possession in the Komatipoort Magistrate&#8217;s Court last week.After Hawks spokesman, Lt Dineo Sekgotodi, broadcasted the information in a press release earlier this week, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) at first denied any knowledge of the case. Sources said it was handled incorrectly. Due to the volume of drugs, it should have been handled as an organised crime.Retired chief prosecutor of Southern KwaZulu-Natal, Mr Ray Sansom, explained that sentencing lies primarily in the domain of the magistrates and judges who exercise their discretion according to common-law principles, precedent and the law. &#8220;In serious cases there are specific laws to tell the courts when to impose minimum sentences,&#8221; he said. The Criminal Law Amendment Act prescribes a minimum sentence of 15 years&#8217; imprisonment for serious drug cases. &#8220;A case involving heroin worth R50 million would definitely fall into this category and is specifically provided for in Schedule ii of the Act. In such a case the magistrate or judge is bound to impose the minimum sentence,&#8221; Sansom said.However, a provision allows a court to consider a lesser sentence, if the accused provided substantial and compelling circumstances which justified the imposition of a lesser sentence. &#8220;The prosecutor in such a case has to add a reference to the minimum sentencing act to the charge to validate it.&#8221;Sansom said if the prosecutor erred and did not include this, other circumstances would still be considered by the court to determine an appropriate sentence.&#8220;The sentence must still fit the crime which has been committed, among other matters.&#8221; The sentence in this case seems way out of context with legal principles, according to Sansom. &#8220;So much so that it is without a doubt inappropriate and shocking.&#8221;He said it was difficult to think that the court could have deviated from the minimum or otherwise appropriate sentence to such a large extent, without the prosecutor or defence attorney providing substantial and compelling facts to persuade the court.&#8220;If nothing of this nature existed in the matter, someone blundered and the prosecuting authority can appeal the sentence,&#8221; Sansom concluded.South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Sanca) Nelspruit director, Ms Marina Erasmus, said the sentencing could only be described as ridiculous. &#8220;We have a huge problem with nyaope (dagga mixed with low-grade heroin).&#8221;Only the abuse of dagga and alcohol is higher, followed by CAT and heroin. NPA spokesman, Ms Monica Nyuswa, said the magistrate felt the sentence was appropriate. She would not explain why the matter had not been considered an organised crime and failed to disclose whether aggravating circumstances were considered for purposes of a higher sentence.Read more here: DRUG BUST ARTICLES
