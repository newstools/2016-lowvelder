MBOMBELA &#8211; According to a representative at Mpumalanga Provincial Disaster Management, it signifies nothing more than &#8220;divorce weather; it comes along with wind and partial rain but leaves you with nothing&#8221;.The South African Weather Services (SAWS) recorded three millimetres of rainfall in 24 hours on Wednesday at Machadodorp, the Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport, and in Mbombela as a whole. One resident measured five millimetres close to Sonpark Boulevard.Also read: Lowveld dam levels critical despite rain&#8220;The rains over the past few days will make no difference,&#8221; the representative told Lowvelder. &#8220;It is important to remember that we are in the neutral phase between El Ni o and La Ni a and predictability is extremely difficult. We are expecting extensive rain in November but it will need to be quite substantial to get us out of the drought slump.&#8221;El Ni o and La Ni a are opposite phases of what is known as the El Ni o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. The SAWS said, &#8220;Although the southern part of Africa generally receives below-normal rainfall during El Ni o years and La Ni a usually brings normal or above-normal rainfall, it cannot be accepted as a rule.&#8221;&#8220;Safe water usage is still very important,&#8221; the representative said. &#8220;When it does rain, there may be instances of localised flooding. The public needs to be very careful.&#8221;Also read: The Lowveld s latest dam levelsMeanwhile, there has been hardly any change to the water levels of five of the Lowveld&#8217;s main dams.Da Gama rose by 0,1 per cent from October 17 to 20, while Nooitgedacht saw no change at all.
