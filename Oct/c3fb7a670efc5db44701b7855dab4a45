We ve decided to leave the country and all that s left to do is to sell the house.You have just made them aware of the urgency of the sale which may adversely affect negotiating a price.We love our house, but it s become too small for us.The buyer may have a similar size family and plans to grow their family. Their idea of space may differ from yours.The kids have all left home and it s too expensive for us to run.Buyers might second guess whether they can afford the property or whether they need so much space.Quite a few people have been to see the house.Interested buyers may start wondering why no one else has put in an offer.I m selling because my divorce has just gone through and I want to get away from the memories.The buyers may be newlyweds buying their first home. They may not want to buy a house with negative vibes.
