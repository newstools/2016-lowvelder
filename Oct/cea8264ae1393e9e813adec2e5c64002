MBOMBELA &#8211; The annual Timeless Face beauty pageant was a resounding success on Saturday.The evening brought with it a slight breeze, which perfectly complemented the delicate scents emanating from the lavender bushes, lining the walkway which leads to the Communio Church&#8217;s large wooden entrance doors.On this auspicious evening these doors gaped wide in welcome, a red carpet slinking across the floor, leading the guests towards the massive auditorium, which was ready and awaiting a spectacular show.No one was disappointed. Spectacular was exactly what the audience received at this glittering, high-impact event, the 10th annual Timeless Face beauty pageant. Guest singers, Corlea Botha and Joanne Fisher Steyn, were assisted by a bevy of limber young dancers.Also read: Ms I&#8217;langa a spectacular affair The contestants, each as lovely as the next, were bejewelled and bedecked with finery ranging from floaty pink chiffon to sleek and slinky black flecked with gold. As they braved the catwalk, flashing pearly white smiles, one would have been forgiven for thinking it was a West End production overseen by the flamboyant Andrew Lloyd Webber.The Timeless Teen SA, Timeless Face SA and Mr Timeless SA contestants were breathtaking. Each brought their own brand of glamour to the stage. Corlea and Joanne raised the roof with their versions of belted-out songs in voices that are second to none.Corlea&#8217;s rendition of &#8220;It&#8217;s All Coming Back to Me Now&#8221; by Pandora&#8217;s Box was masterfully performed. Her version of Jennifer Rush&#8217;s &#8220;Power of Love&#8221; was exceptionally beautiful.Both of these vocal performances are not easy feats to emulate, belonging to masters of their game as they are, and yet strength and emotion poured out of her. The songs she and Joanne performed together, raised the roof and every heart in the room belonged to them for that while.Also read: Fun day at Penryn attracts many Accompanying these two divas were a group of hand-picked dancers. Athletic and agile, they were the perfect complement to the singers. Their dance to &#8220;Power of Love&#8221; with the addition of canes, top hats and tails turned a beautifully performed song into a show, and all eyes were on them.A violin and guitar duet performed halfway through the evening was so skilfully performed, one could have heard a pin drop. As the glorious sounds of the violin died away, the electric guitar came in to accompany the singers on Bon Jovi&#8217;s &#8220;Living on a Prayer&#8221;, with a bit of a twist.The hosts were witty and elegant, the lighting and visual effects were outstanding and the music was a fabulous showcasing of local talent. The Timeless Teen SA, Timeless Face SA and Mr Timeless SA contestants were professional and looked the part, strutting their stuff with skill.Were you there?
