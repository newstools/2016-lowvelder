MBOMBELA &#8211; Many locals and visitors have said it, but now it has been proved to be true. Mbombela has the worst drivers in South Africa! According to insights published by Discovery Insure, based on findings from its Driving Challenge App, this city ranked last on the 10 cities measured. We did, however, score a firm first place when it came to cities with the fastest speedsters.More than 30 000 people downloaded the app in the hope of winning a R10 000 fuel voucher but much to the disappointment of our local motorists, the results recorded did not reflect very positively on sunny Mbombela&#8217;s road users.Port Elizabeth was ranked as the city with the best drivers in South Africa with Cape Town second and Bloemfontein third. The findings also suggested that Pretoria was home to the most distracted drivers with Johannesburg taking second place.The fairer sex will also be glad to hear that once again it was established that women were better drivers than men and especially achieved better scores when it came to avoiding harsh acceleration, balanced cornering and keeping to the speed limit. When personality types were brought into the equation it became evident that both conscientious and neurotic drivers fared the best while extroverts made the worst drivers.Although cities like Port Elizabeth and Cape Town might boast about their achievements, it looks like it might be a case of simply being the best of the worst. According to the Road Safety Annual Report of 2013 done by the International Traffic Safety Data and Analysis Group, South Africa has an average of 28 fatalities for every 100 000 road users, which was among the highest rates worldwide. The year 2013 was also the last time South Africa was featured in this report.According to its findings we really need to work on the following factors: Driver fitness with particular focus on documentation, fatigue, alcohol and substance abuse Moving violations: particularly barrier lines, red-light infringements, cellphones, speeding, seat-belt usage, following distances, inconsiderate driving, reckless and negligent driving Public transport; enforcement; particularly vehicle fitness, documentation and load management Vehicle fitness: particularly documentation, roadworthiness and registration-plate enforcement Pedestrian safety: particularly pedestrian jay-walking, drinking and walking and crime prevention: support of proactive policing.In short, although some cities in South Africa did fare a bit better, or in our case a bit worse than the rest, no one really has the right to boast as we are collectively pretty awful drivers.See all the findings of the Discovery Insure Driving Challenge here
