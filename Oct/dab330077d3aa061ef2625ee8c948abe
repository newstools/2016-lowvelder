MBOMBELA &#8211; A five-star guest house which started with only one room 21 years ago, has been named the best in South Africa.Loerie&#8217;s Call was the winner in its category at the 2016 National Lilizela Awards at the Sandton Convention Centre on Sunday. The awards were established by the National Department of Tourism in 2013 to recognise exemplary service in tourism and hospitality.Mr Marius Kolesky established it in 1995, when Leana redecorated staff accommodation for friends and family.&#8220;I spent too much,&#8221; she tells Lowvelder, &#8220;so Marius said I had to earn back the money.&#8221;She had the owners of what was then the only other three guest houses in town, over for tea.&#8220;I showed them my room and asked that they refer anyone they couldn&#8217;t accommodate, to me.&#8221;Soon it was full every night. She charged R90 for an individual, and R125 for a couple. &#8220;I was excited. And then I wanted to make a point.&#8221; Slowly the Koleskys started adding additional rooms, three at a time.Fifteen years ago she decided to get graded, and Loerie&#8217;s Call was awarded five stars. &#8220;It is easier to get than to keep,&#8221; she says.&#8220;It is important to get graded though. Not only for marketing purposes, but the process teaches you to get to a certain level.&#8221; Leana said she changed small things often. They are also interactive, updating their website regularly and interacting with guests on social media.Manager, Ms Cindy Machete, said the win was all down to teamwork.&#8220;There was no one individual who made it happen. We are all making the dream work.&#8221;When she joined Loerie&#8217;s Call two years ago, it was with the idea to work at a five-star guest house. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect it would become the best five-star place,&#8221; she said.Other National Lilizela Awards winners from the Lowveld are:Best wildlife encounters &#8211; Inyati Game Lodge at Sabi SandsBest five-star game lodge &#8211; Jock Safari Lodge near SkukuzaBest three-star meeting, exhibition and special-events place &#8211; Ingwenyama Conference &amp; Sports Resort.
