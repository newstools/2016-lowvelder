MBOMBELA &#8211; Being a paramedic is 90 per cent boredom and 10 per cent sheer terror. This is how ER24 branch manager Mr Greg Wilcox describes the work they do. Lowvelder accompanied Wilcox on a recent Friday night to truly experience what it was like to be part of emergency services.Wilcox is fondly nicknamed &#8220;House&#8221; due to his looks and style being similar to those of the television series&#8217; Dr Gregory House. The night started slowly. The first stop was at ER24&#8217;s offices which are situated behind Mediclinic Nelspruit. Ambulances and a Toyota Hilux fitted with state-of-the-art equipment, are all clearly marked with their logos and emergency numbers.
