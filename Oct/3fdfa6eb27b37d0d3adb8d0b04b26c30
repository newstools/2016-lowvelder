MBOMBELA &#8211; There were no signs or symptoms. She had enjoyed 20/20 vision before it happened. She simply woke one day to the absence of light and the prognosis that she might never see again.Upon examination, ophthalmic surgeon, Dr Johan Eksteen, found bilateral multiple, deep retinal and sub-retinal, white inflammatory lesions. In other words, both of her eyes were seriously damaged.Three years later, partial vision miraculously returned to her right eye. According to the specialists, she should not be seeing.It meant she was able to return to her passion, dancing. Six years after she first lost her sight, she choreographed her story into a ballet called Dance Visions.Also read: Boy s first day at school a miraclePresented by the Shirley Ric-Hansen Ballet School at the Mbombela Civic Theatre and featuring Penny Wolhuter, the show traced Candice&#8217;s life from childhood through her emotions and fears to the breakthrough moment.Hers is a story of never giving up.Now married to Lloyd Street, Candice is determined to present the message of encouragement and faith to others. She says without the help of her family members, optometrist Keith Kirton, Eksteen and dance teacher, Shirley Ric-Hansen and the White River Rotary Club, her experience would have been much more difficult. The Rotary Club raised significant funds to help Candice complete matric using low-vision aids.She also says before agreeing to go forward with Dance Visions, she did not like to speak about what happened to her.&#8220;It was such a complicated thing that happened to me. It felt difficult to speak about. It was easier to express it through dance. So that is what we did,&#8221; she says. Candice is now a teacher at Shirley Ric-Hansen Ballet School, where she used to be a student. It was her colleagues who convinced her to tell her story through dance.When her eyesight partially returned she started studying to become a Real Academy of Dance (RAD) teacher, an internationally recognised qualification.Before I regained my eyesight, I was asked what I wanted to be one day. I said I wanted to be a ballet teacher. Everyone thought I was crazy,&#8221; she says.&#8220;But then I told Shirley about it. She was my dance teacher since I was 13. And she said, &#8216;Miracles happen.&#8217; And a miracle did.&#8221;Also see: VIDEO: Medical volunteers give over 40 people a smileCandice had been relearning how to dance as a visually impaired person. &#8220;Everyone used to get very nervous when I was dancing. I could also hear them crying, quietly. We had to get special permission from RAD in London in order for me to do my exam. I wanted to be marked as an able-bodied person,&#8221; she adds. Shirley and Candice agree it must have been a lot of pressure for the examiner, as she was the first visually impaired dancer to take an academy exam. Candice had just started to pick up bright lights and luminous colours. She could make out the corners and walls of the examination room.She had to work out everything for herself. She had guts and determination and never gave up.&#8220;That is what she has shown the other girls at the ballet school. They had to try and interpret what she went through and bring it across on stage,&#8221; Shirley says.&#8220;You can do anything if you put your mind to it. Candice is absolute proof of that.&#8221;Kirton says it is still inexplicable that she can see. &#8220;When you look at the inside of her eyes, there is no way that she should be seeing at all. Something has changed which allows her to see but just as her eyesight suddenly came back, it could disappear quickly again. She has to take each day as it comes,&#8221; he says.&#8220;Unfortunately, there is not much more we can do in terms of optometry.&#8221;For Candice, it has been a long, difficult journey. She is grateful to be able to see and grateful to have been able to share her story with others.&#8220;At the ballet school, we teach our students to never give up. The word &#8216;can&#8217;t&#8217; is not allowed.&#8221;
