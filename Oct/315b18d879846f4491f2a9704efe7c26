Heritage and cultural activist, David Okki Petersen from Nelsville, is using his artistic abilities to preserve the history of Khoisans in the province. To make people aware of the Khoisan community, Petersen says cultural villages need to be established in the province and elsewhere in the country.&#8220;These villages will not exclude other ethnic groups from the country, but will be an inclusive harbour where we will be able to preserve our culture and heritage through art.&#8221;
