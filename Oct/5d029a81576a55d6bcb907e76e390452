The Lowveld Angling and Boat Association Skiboat (LABA Skiboat) recently returned from an action packed social competition in Ponta do Ouro, reported newcomer Kallie van Staden.He provided Lowvelder with his day-by-day account of what he had experienced. The road to Ponta do Ouro is not an easy one if you re a new comer like me. But once you re there the happiness and festive vibe takes over,&#8221; he said . Although the weather was not that easy from a fishing point of view, we luckily had some R&amp;R (rum and raspberry) and divine dining spots to try out,&#8221; he said.Jaco Retief, Daniek van Staden and Jon Jon van Staden with Skipper Stefan Retief.According to Kallie, this year s competition attracted 12 vessels. &#8220;We hope that the bar we have set will attract more members for the competitions to come,&#8221; he added. According to Kallie, the Laba committee put in a lot of effort to gather sponsors and, eventually, sponsorships worth R110 000 were given towards the competition.Arno Jansen with the week&#8217;s biggest catch weighing 14 kilograms.&nbsp;&#8220;This is a new record for LABA Skiboat,&#8221; he said and added &#8220;this goes to show how people love fisherman as we do not find ourselves in the best financial times.&#8221; His day-by-day account of the competition proves that fun was had by all, regardless of some challenges.Also read: Pasta evening with Warrior Rick Also read: Loock to compete at coveted competition &nbsp;He jotted down the following: Day 1 A pretty messed up surf with a South-eastern creating nice waves. Everyone got out and it was stywe lyne , but the weather worsened and the last vessel on land beached at about 14h00. Only four units weighing in.Day 2 The wind never stopped, as the protected bay from the Southern wind looked beautiful the 3.5m swells made it impossible to fish as soon as you turned the Ponta point and the wind got to you. Thus we blew out!Day 3 This was it. Come hell or high water and no pun indented. The Fishing was on the way with the first nice day in the last five. With basically no wind and no surf there were no issues getting out, the down side was that the fish had the same feeling as the weather. We at least weighed a bit more fish and tagged and released a bill fish.According to Kallie, the fish that was caught did not amount to a lot. &#8220;But at least the boys were out on the water,&#8221; he said. As none of the juniors weighed a fish, the prizes intended for their categories were handed out during lucky draws. &#8220;Not one of them left empty handed,&#8221; he stressed.The men made time for a, occasional cold one.&#8220;We as members of LABA SkiBoat would like to thank all of our Sponsors. This is something that we will build on; our Sponsors can look forward to our support,&#8221; he added.Overall outcome:3rd Best Angler John Wattress (Mbombela) 2nd best Angler Jaco Retief (White River) Best Angler Arno Jansen (White River)Biggest fish Esperanza 14.1kg Dorado (White River)Most Releases Koert Barnard &#8211; 1 Billfish (Jhb)5th Boat This Side Up (Nelspruit) 4th Boat Esperanza (White River) 3rd Boat Sangoma 2 (Swaziland) 2nd Ski John Watress (Swaziland) 1st Ski Ou Ryperd (Jhb)&nbsp;
