MBOMBELA &#8211; Patients presenting with symptoms of a stroke should seek medical assistance as soon as possible to improve their chances of recovery.This was the message from StepMed Rehab, which presented a workshop on how to deal with strokes at Nelspruit Mediclinic recently, to observe World Stroke Day.According to StepMed Rehab&#8217;s Dirk Lourens, people often relax after experiencing the symptoms of a stroke due to the unavailability of information about it.The most common symptoms include a sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body, blurred vision and loss of balance or coordination.&#8220;In some cases, a person will say they want to rest in order for the symptoms to go away,&#8221; Lourens said.Also read: How to treat heat stroke in children &#8211; naturallyHe said there was proof that the sooner the patient received appropriate emergency treatment at a medical centre after experiencing these warning signs, the better their chances of recovery and survival.&#8220;Anyone who is suspected of having suffered a stroke should be rushed to a treatment facility that specialises in this life-threatening condition immediately,&#8221; he said.Lourens added that not much has been done to educate and raise awareness about strokes. It left most patients with life-changing disabilities such as losing the use of a limb, chronic pain, the inability to speak, difficulty reading as well as the disturbance of memory or emotions.Also read: Solution needed for child obesity However, the effects can be reversed if treated within the first three hours of onset.The most common kind of stroke, about 85 per cent of cases, is an ischaemic stroke. These occur when a clot in a blood vessel disrupts supply to a part of the brain. This causes the affected area to become starved of oxygen and results in the rapid death of brain cells.Also read: Three hours can change the course of your life The other kind of stroke is hemorrhagic, caused by a bleed in the brain.
