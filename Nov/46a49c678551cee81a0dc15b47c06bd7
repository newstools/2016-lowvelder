It seeks to address the consumerist age we live in.How to Celebrate Buy Nothing DayPeople who observe Buy Nothing Day can do many things to express their objection to our consumer-based culture, according to www.daysoftheyear.com.The website also says:&#8220;They may simply stay home with friends and family rather than going shopping.Some people have taken advantage of the lack of shopping on that day, and used the time to instead celebrate nature and the immense amount of beauty it offers us, free of charge. This can be done by spending the day in the countryside or the mountains, or even in a park, resting in the sunshine and enjoying the breeze.Some other participants stand in a shopping mall with a pair of scissors and a poster that advertises help for people who want to put an end to their mounting credit card debt and shopping addiction with one simple cut.Some argue that Buy Nothing Day can be the start of a life-changing lifestyle commitment, where others claim it s meaningless, as observers simply buy more the following day. Either way, there s no doubt that going without buying anything for an entire day is quite a challenge in the modern world, and will serve to make you think about what your life is really about.&#8221;&nbsp;
