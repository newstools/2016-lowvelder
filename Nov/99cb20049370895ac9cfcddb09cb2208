MBOMBELA &#8211; The newly formed City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) is in the process of creating a new development plan.Consultative meetings on the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) started on Tuesday. Stakeholders such as organised businesses and councillors attended the meeting at the civic centre.Opposition parties expected the municipality to revisit its past plans and deliver on its developmental promises before it could talk of developing another IDP.This was the first consultation meeting and was aimed at analysing the municipality&#8217;s demographic features and level of basic service delivery.It revealed that CMLM is faced with a housing shortage due to what it calls a &#8220;lack of suitable land for residential development&#8221;.The municipality also said there was a shortage of serviced stands and inadequate resources for the supply of housing subsides.Also read: Steiltes&#8217; electricity problems soon to be a things of the pastLocal business leaders also voiced their expectations. The Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism&#8217;s (KLCBT) chairman, Pastor TJ Mar , said more efforts should be made to improve roads and bulk water supply.&#8220;We have been actively lobbying for new bulk reservoirs for quite some time, including a large dam in the De Kaap River system.Although it is not the municipality&#8217;s responsibility to provide dams, we request that they provide for it in their integrated governmental plans, because without water the city cannot hope to attract more investors or more tourists. No business can happen without water,&#8221; said Mar .Also read: Disregard for the law hampers delivery KLCBT COO, Ms Linda Grimbeek, presented the rest of the points which were gathered from input by its members.These included a craft market for both Mbombela and Hazyview, where visitors can buy crafts in a safe and clean place with credit-card facilities.
