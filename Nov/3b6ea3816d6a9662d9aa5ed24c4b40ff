MBOMBELA &#8211; In a relatively short period of time newly appointed Steval Pumas head coach, Brent Janse van Rensburg (36), has made his mark in the coaching stakes. First and foremost, he believes that culture is the most important element in a team, and that the various departments that form part of the Mpumalanga Rugby Union should share the same vision.&#8220;You can have all the game plans at hand, but to achieve success there must be a consistency of character. The players must buy into the Pumas&#8217; way and drive with purpose and meaning. Only then we can set a benchmark. We must remain purpose- driven,&#8221; Janse van Rensburg said.
