HAZYVIEW &#8211; The roadside stalls next to the R40 which were demolished in the first week of October, have mostly been rebuilt and business is booming.When this paper drove past recently, five vehicles were parked along the yellow line.The informal traders have been warned on numerous occasions that operating on this stretch of road is in direct contravention of the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) Founding Act.According to Sanral, the stall owners were informed by letter six weeks in advance about the demolition date.Also read: Vendors a cause for concern The organisation is also aware that the illegal traders are operating again and said it would endeavour to consult with the municipality and traders to come to a solution whereby the traders and road users are not endangered in any way.DA councillor Ms Elsie Janse van Rensburg brought the matter to City of Mbombela council last month.In her letter, she mentioned that, &#8220;Hawker stalls have been developed in safe areas along the N4,&#8221; at Karino and Matsulu. &#8220;Could the same be done along the R40 instead of destroying the livelihood of 50 to 60 families in one day?&#8221;She emphasised the situation was a sad reflection of the lack of communication among the various sectors.&#8220;Were consultations held between Sanral, the traders, the producers of the fresh produce in the area and the government to identify possible fresh produce market areas along main roads, thus stimulating local economic development? If not, why not?&#8221;She told the newspaper that the traders should be able to sell their goods legally and in close proximity to their homes.&#8220;As the City of Mbombela Local Municipality, we should be taking care of our people,&#8221; Janse van Rensburg said.The general manager for city planning and development, Mr DD Mabuza, responded to Janse van Rensburg&#8217;s letter in the council minutes.&#8220;The traders were removed by Sanral without the knowledge of City of Mbombela. We have already started engagements with Sanral on the matter,&#8221; it reads.According to the response, the R40 towards Hazyview was not accommodated in the current financial year.Janse van Rensburg suggested moving the stalls behind the fence on the R40 and creating an off-ramp so that vehicles can stop safely.Mr Chris Harvie of the Hazyview Chamber of Business and Commerce (HCBT), said he was quite confident that headway would be made soon, in terms of providing facilities for the traders close to where they are currently situated.The HCBT hopes to meet representatives from Sanral in November to discuss the matter.
