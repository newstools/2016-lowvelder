MBOMBELA &#8211; Zaytoon Farms is celebrating its ninth year in business this month, but the company also has another reason to celebrate.The poultry farm was honoured with a bronze certificate by the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and Environmental Affairs at the provincial abattoir-rating awards last month.The awards are aimed at promoting the supply of safe and wholesome meat to consumers.With the food insecurities, especially poultry, the objective is to provide secondary processing plants and consumers with the means of identifying abattoirs which consistently deliver hygienically produced meat to the benefit of both consumers and retailers.Zaytoon Farms grows chickens to adulthood and boasts a fully certified abattoir on site.During the awards, Zaytoon competed with the larger abattoirs in the area. Some of them produced more than 500 000 chickens a week, compared to the estimated 30 000 of the farm.According to Ms Huibrie Viljoen from Zaytoon, they were grateful to be recognised among other worthy role players in poultry farming.&#8220;We are proud as a small abattoir. Having to compete against some of the best and still being able to come out victorious, motivates us. It shows that we are doing our best to produce clean food,&#8221; Viljoen said.Also read: Does the chicken on your table add up? Last year Zaytoon was rewarded for being the most improved abattoir at the same awards ceremony.&#8220;This does not come easy, as random inspections are done by governmental veterinary public-health representatives, to check if industrial standards are met. The industry is in turmoil,&#8221; she said.&#8220;We recently experienced a period of dire drought but we still were able to do well. We have managed to raise the standard because we want to give the best to our customers.&#8221;Also read: Beef up on how beef is classified The company supplies some of the biggest stores and distributors in the Lowveld.It aims to expand its reach to become a leader in supplying only the highest quality chicken products.Some of its clients include food retailers such as Crossing SUPERSPAR, The Grove SUPERSPAR, Malalane SUPERSPAR, Plaza SUPERSPAR, Orchards SPAR and Sonpark SPAR.Viljoen added that Zaytoon&#8217;s dream for the near future is to start processing the chicken into polony and other products needed on the market.The company has already constructed a building for this purpose.
