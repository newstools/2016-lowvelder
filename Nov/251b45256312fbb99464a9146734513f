In a newsletter dated October 12, 2015 addressed to BIVE investors, Erasmus claims: We have received confirmation form a funding group in Switzerland, that they have approved the funding required to construct infrastructure, holiday resort, medical facility, the offices and other sections on BIVE. It continues: Construction is expected to commence in March 2016. On November 19, Erasmus reiterated to investors that we expect to commence full scale with the development, which will undoubtedly lead to the significant growth on the investment we have all made. When asked about this promising investment, Erasmus said the 60 million Euros from an organisation called ICS was meant for the entire development. It was ostensibly approved, but BIVE declined it on the unfavourable terms offered. The funding amount was too high at that stage and we requested from the funders to reduce the funding amount. This amount was in fact reduced to an amount of 20 million Euros as the funders stated that this was the minimum amount they were willing to enter into an agreement on. He added that he approached the organisation again two weeks before the interview with Lowvelder to obtain less funding only two million Euros. I never said I would do it in a certain time. I am a developer, I am not a resort operator, I don t want a resort. Erasmus did not want to elaborate on who the prospective resort operator was supposed to be, as it was confidential due to a non-disclosure agreement, but said they have since withdrawn due to negative perceptions about conflict in the country.He denied misleading anyone. The funding company did not withdraw the approval. We requested that we postpone the taking up of the funding until all parties are ready to commence. He would not allow Lowvelder a close look at the ICS document, despite claims to the contrary.
