23-year old Nkosiyaze Ncube from Inanda is the first person to be injected with the new HIV vaccine. Watch the exclusive footage here: In line with World Aids Day tomorrow, a landmark clinical trial to test whether a vaccine regimen can prevent HIV infection in the South African population, kicks off today.The vaccine will be administered to 5 400 participants in the trial at 15 research sites. It will take about 20 months for the vaccine to be administered to all the participants in the trial.They are the MRC HRPU Research Site in Verulam and the Setshaba Research Centre in Soshanguve. Activation of the Emavundleni Clinical Research Centre is expected to take place soon.With more than 1 000 people becoming infected with HIV every day in South Africa we are in dire need of better HIV prevention options despite recent advances. A safe and effective HIV vaccine would go a long way towards ending HIV in the country.A modified form of the only vaccine regimen that has shown a measure of efficacy in preventing HIV infection will be used in the trial. The regimen was tested in the RV144 trial which is known as the Thai study. A 31 percent reduction in HIV infections after 3.5 years was reported.The modified vaccine has been tested in a smaller trial HVTN 100 with the immune-system response shown by participants meeting the expected criteria thus justifying proceeding with HVTN 702.It will test whether a combination of vaccines is:All volunteers must be aged between 18 and 35, sexually active, in general good health and HIV-negative.HVTN 702 is a placebo-controlled trial, meaning that participants are randomly assigned to two groups where one group will receive the test vaccines and the other will receive a placebo which is a simple saline solution.During the trial all participants will be counselled to continue using established methods of HIV protection, but existing methods are imperfect and some participants will acquire HIV during the study.If HVTN 702 shows the study vaccine to be effective, this trial could dramatically change the course of the HIV epidemic.
