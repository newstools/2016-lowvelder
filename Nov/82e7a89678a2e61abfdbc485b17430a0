MBOMBELA &#8211; Your entire home may not be yours, regardless of whether you have a title deed confirming ownership.This is in terms of a rule that requires the structures on your yard to correspond with your property&#8217;s plans file at the municipality you reside in.The effect of this rule:Before the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act (SPLUMA), no law could adequately ensure that home buyers purchased properties that were in order according to both their municipalities and the deeds office.Also read: Allegations fly over new SPLUMA act. Factual situations that may have caused such discrepancies include:1.) Neighbours agreeing to change the boundaries of their adjacent properties without registering the agreement in the deeds oofice.2.) Property owners whose property border nature reserves or open veld unlawfully built onto that neighbouring land.One municipality that has since issued regulations to address this, is the City of Mbombela Local Municipality. Its regulations, issued in terms of section 70 of the SPLUMA act, has changed the position of sellers and purchasers:Before the regulation (this status quo still applies in many municipalities countrywide): A purchaser who seeks to buy a property, must visit his local municipality.There, he must request the municipality-approved building plans pertaining to the property.If it does not correspond with what is on the property, an architect or building planner must be hired to draw up plans reflecting the structures on the property. An inspector from the municipality will visit the property and evaluate whether the plan adequately reflects the situation on the yard and whether it is in keeping with municipality regulations.The purchaser buys the property and becomes responsible for it. Accordingly, if it is discovered that the structures do not correspond with the plans at the municipality, the purchaser becomes responsible for the situation.This may entail:&#8211; Demolishing structures that have not been approved.&#8211; Transferring the part of the property not reflected on the municipality&#8217;s records (see B) to its rightful owner (the person on whose land that part is located, according to the municipality.)&#8211; Registering a servitude for the purchaser&#8217;s use of the land that structures have been erected upon.&#8211; Remunerating the owner of the land his structures are encroaching upon.Also read: Leopard Creek property owners locked in dispute After the regulation (this applies to any property transfers submitted to the Mpumalanga deeds office since May 1, 2016): Prior to the property being transferred, the seller signs a so-called section 70 certificate.This certificate states that the rates and taxes in respect of the property has been paid. It also indicates that the plans pertaining to the property, are in order and filed with (for example) the City of Mbombela Local Municipality.A municipality inspector will attend to the property to ensure that the information on the section 70 certificate is correct and valid. If not, the property sale may be halted or a stop may be put to it.If, in time, this seems not to have been the case at the time of the property transfer, the purchaser will have legal recourse against the seller.
