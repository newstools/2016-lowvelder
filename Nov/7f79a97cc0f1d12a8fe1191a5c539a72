PHUMLANI &#8211; &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to leave just tyre tracks in the places we visit, we want to leave a gift and a good impression.&#8221;These are the words of Drew Alexander, who on behalf of the Wellspring International Outreach (WIO) charity, is organising the construction of a kitchen which will feed the orphans of the Phumlani community. Most of those involved with the American organisation, from the donors to the volunteers, are bikers.This is not the first time WIO has travelled to the Lowveld. Two years ago, Alexander was in Msholozi with the founder of the charity organisation, Neale Bayly, to build homes for two families in need.Also read: Bingo fun all in the name of charityDuring this visit, the members were sad to see the state of the kitchen and how some children in Phumlani had no cutlery or plates and were eating outside &#8211; with no protection from the elements.While Alexander and his colleague Mark Fincham are organising the construction of the community kitchen, a group of WIO bikers is travelling up the Garden Route from Cape Town all the way to Swaziland, the Kruger National Park and to Phumlani. There, they will check the progress of the building and hand out 100 pairs of sandals to the orphans, most of whom have never owned a pair of shoes.Alexander says these sandals, made by another charity organisation, are extra special as they are size adjustable. This means the new owners will be able to wear them as their feet grow for up to five sizes &#8211; living up to the product&#8217;s motto: the shoe that grows. And the manufacturers, Because International, offer a five-year guarantee to boot.Alexander adds it is wonderful to see how the children react to things that many people take for granted.Sometimes, the smallest gifts become the biggest things,&#8221; he says.WIO has asked local company, Wendy Lane Nelspruit, to help with the construction of the kitchen, which started two weeks ago. Alexander is grateful to the owners of Stonecrop Lodge in White River for providing him and his fellow bikers with free accommodation.Also watch: VIDEO: Community once again shows its support in search for missing manCharles Sanderson of Child Welfare, who works mostly in the Phumlani and Msholozi areas, says Alexander and the WIO organisation are more than friends; they are like family.For more information about WIO and the work it does, visit www.wellspring-outreach.org.
