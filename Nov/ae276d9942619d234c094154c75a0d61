If you only get to see one astronomical event this year, make it the record-breaking Supermoon in November. On Monday the 14th of November there will be a Supermoon and according to scientists, this is the closest the earth has been to the moon since January 1948.&#8220;The full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016, but also the closest full moon to date in the 21st century,&#8221; says NASA. &#8220;The full moon won t come this close to Earth again until 25 November 2034.&#8221;During this phenomenon the Moon will appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter.So how does a supermoon occur?According to NASA, the moon has an elliptical orbit with two sides, one called the perigee, which is about 48 280km closer to the earth than the other side, which is called the apogee.When the Sun, Moon and Earth align as the Moon orbits the Earth, it is called syzygy (A new word to remember for your next Scrabble game).When a Earth-Moon-Sun alignment occurs with the perigee side of the Moon facing Earth, and the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, we get a perigee-syzygy.This causes the moon to appear much bigger and brighter than usual, and this is what we call a supermoon, or technically, a perigee Moon.READ MORE: Rare Blue Moon Visible TonightSupermoons aren t uncommon as we just had one on October 16, and after the November Supermoon we ll have another one on December 14. Because the November Supermoon becomes full within about 2 hours of perigee, it is going to look the biggest it has in almost seven decades.Make sure to tell all your photographer friends about the supermoon and make sure that you capture the full moon in all its magnificence.
