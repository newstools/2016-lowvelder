MBOMBELA &#8211; The Office of the Premier (OTP) is denying making any deal with the Gupta family.A whistle-blower in government this week alleged the opposite: that the province has agreed to a R7-million deal with the Gupta-owned newspaper, The New Age (TNA).The OTP said it was allowing the newspaper to make presentations and proposals &#8220;just like any other media house&#8221;, and this should not be viewed as an indication that it was committing to doing business with the newspaper, said spokesman, Mr Zibonele Mncwango.Also read: Over R22 million lost from coffers According to a letter sent to the DA by a frustrated government employee, TNA&#8217;s proposal to the OTP was for a partnership to publish a daily newspaper which will include the provincial government&#8217;s events and projects on its first three pages.The employee wanted the DA to help stop the deal because government was failing to fix lifts in its offices.Also read: Mabuza denies political rift He also said employees were forced to share overcrowded offices and more than 200 officials had to share less than four printers for the printing and copying of documents.The proposal was followed by a meeting between a delegation from TNA and the provincial government communicator&#8217;s forum (PGCF). The company made a presentation to the PGCF on September 28 at the Ehlanzeni District Municipality&#8217;s offices.Heads of communication from various government departments also attended.During the meeting, the newspaper proposed that it would print 8 000 copies of the newspapers to be distributed for free in the province.Also read: Minister commends premier It would also train journalism students from Mpumalanga.

They wanted to know who authorised the company to use government logos in their documents.They questioned the relationship between TNA and the Mpumalanga Government.

Mncwango did not confirm or deny this.&#8220;It is clear that the DA is on a smear campaign, they are trying to opportunistically link the honourable premier with the Guptas. The premier is his own person and has no business dealings whatsoever with the Guptas,&#8221; said Mncwango.According to Mncwango, the director-general has directed the communications directorate to prepare an open tender process for all interested media houses.&#8220;The directorate has been instructed to make necessary provisions in the 2017/18 budget for the tender process,&#8221; he said.The OTP didn&#8217;t respond to questions why the TNA delegation used the provincial government&#8217;s coat of arms.
