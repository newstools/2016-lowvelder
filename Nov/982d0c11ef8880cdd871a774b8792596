MBOMBELA &#8211; For Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit, helping their fellow man does not end with security-related matters. The staff has come to the aid of a family with two special-needs children.Lowvelder recently reported on Mr Huey and Ms Petru Potgieter&#8217;s plight to provide their four-year-old son, Cyrus, with a much-needed operation they could not afford. His younger brother, Xerxes (2), also has special needs. The boys met the staff at Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit on Wednesday morning. Staff members are collecting money to go towards Cyrus&#8217; operation.Hi-Tech response manager,Mr Callum Mac Pherson, took the family around the offices and showed the children the control room and their medical-emergency vehicles. Mac Pherson said so far the staff had raised around R10 000. Petru explained how Cyrus was born with ptosis, commonly known as &#8220;lazy-eye&#8221;.&#8220;When he was born the doctor told us he would have to have an operation every two years.&#8221; This was because the eyelid would have to be lifted as Cyrus grew older. &#8220;He had his first operation after he was born, and now he has to have another procedure.&#8221;&#8220;The doctor never picked up that Xerxes was mentally challenged while I was pregnant. We only found out after he was four months old, after he was hospitalised twice for pneumonia due to constant reflux.&#8221; Petro said that Dasha Foundation has offered Xerxes a place at the school once he is old enough to attend.&#8220;They said they will help arrange a payment plan for the fees,&#8221; she said. Huey explained that Cyrus&#8217; operation, which has to be done in Pretoria, will cost R18 000 and his new glasses another R4 000. &#8220;This might not be a fortune for some people, but it is for us. Even though both of us are working, we just make ends meet.&#8221;The cost of the operation was overwhelming for them, never mind the costs of travelling to Pretoria and staying there while Cyrus has the procedure.&#8220;We are so thankful for Hi-Tech Security for trying to help us. A thousand blessings to all their staff,&#8221; Petro concluded.Hi-Tech general manager, Mr Vernon Lancaster, said they would know exactly how much they had collected by next week.
