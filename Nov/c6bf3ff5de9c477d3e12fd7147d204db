Mbombela-  Bring Change Africa as an organisation that supports growth and development of entrepreneurs and the community. They have different areas they focus on. In South Africa, they have Johannesburg, Pretoria and Lowveld. They also cover Botswana.  This week on Monday, Bring Change Africa Lowveld donated R5000 to Kamagugu Inclusive School. According to their Facebook page, Kamagugu Inclusive School has around 330 enrolled students, mostly with multi-disabilities. “You can live in the Lowveld for years and not know about these places, and how badly they need the support of the community”, said Bring Change founder, Ettiene Pretorius. His wife, Erichia Pretorius added, “It is not only important that we help the schools that are overlooked, but that we tell the community about these schools, so that more people are aware of them. We aim to raise funds and support within our projects to create a sustainable change socially and we will be using our funds to support educational based initiatives.” They also donated R5000 at Hoërskool Nelspruit’s fund for less fortunate children at Radio Lowveld, on Tuesday morning.
