SKUKUZA &#8211; The Kruger National Park (KNP) has natural assets, other than rhinos and elephants, that are being well protected.A grove of pepper-bark trees (Warburgia salutaris) is an intensely guarded heritage jewel.Since 2012, tree protectors &#8211; sponsored by Sappi &#8211; guard these treasures. This forms part of a special project aimed at combating the illegal harvesting of Warburgia, as well as facilitating the conservation thereof.
