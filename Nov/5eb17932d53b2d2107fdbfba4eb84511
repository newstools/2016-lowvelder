MBOMBELA &#8211; It was held at Nelspruit Golf Club on Friday in aid of Kerri Dunshea and Annalize du Plessis, who will start their challenging ascent of Mt Kilimanjaro at the end of this month.The golf day went a long way in helping the pair raise more funds for causes close to their hearts. It was played in a better-ball Stableford format. Japie Bester and Gert Heunis were victorious with 47 points.Hot on their heels were Monja Richards &#8211; who turned pro in 2005 &#8211; and Nidene Stapelberg with 46 points.Du Plessis has been wanting to climb Kili for about three years now, but has never met the right partner until she approached Dunshea while she was training at the gym. &#8220;I went up to Kerri and asked her, &#8216;What are you training for?&#8217; and she said, Kilimanjaro. I was so surprised. We are the perfect match.&#8221;A part of the funds raised will be donated to baby Daniel Ferreira who was diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastoma, a type of eye cancer, just a few months ago.&#8220;We hope to raise R140 000 for WCC and another R300 000 for baby Daniel and Wessa. Rhino poaching is also an issue that is close to our hearts. It is so cruel and we have a passion for rhinos.&#8221;A group of 22 hikers will take on this epic journey with Du Plessis and Dunshea, who will be the only two South Africans to climb for WCC. They have decided not to fly to Kilimanjaro, but to cover the 3 900 kilometres by car.&#8220;We encourage people to follow our journey on our Instagram page, Spirit Lion Heart. We also formed an organisation, the Lion Heart Fund. We would like to invite the community to reach out to children and charities in need.&#8221;Dunshea has done the Argus before and also supports a lot of local races while Du Plessis has run the Comrades three times before.&#8220;We would like to thank everyone for their support.&#8221;Anyone who would like to contribute can contact Dunshea on 082-573-3372.Kilimanjaro WCC Golf Day results 1 Japie Bester and Gert Heunis &#8211; 47 2 Monja Richards and Nidene Stapelberg &#8211; 46 3 Danie Slabbert and Albert Hattingh &#8211; 45.
