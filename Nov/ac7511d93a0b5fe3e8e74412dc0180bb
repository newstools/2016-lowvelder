MBOMBELA &#8211; The first Sunrise Women Awards took place at Bundu Lodge on Saturday night and it was nothing short of a glamorous affair.The awards were established to recognise women who have excelled in various sectors ranging from the media, humanitarian services to fashion design and entrepreneurship.Over 100 guests celebrated the winners. Special guest, Miss Mpumalanga 2016, Elaine Mkhabela was also acknowledged for her achievements.According to the project manager, Nothando Prudence Makhushe, the awards aimed at empowering, honouring, and appreciating the women who motivate and inspire those around them. Born leaders receive prestige awards&#8220;I started these awards to honour and appreciate all women who work hard in their communities.&#8221; Makhushe said most women in Mpumalanga and South Africa were not appreciated.&#8220;Aside from the hard work that they do at a salon or orphanage, they still go home with a smile. Hence I have decided to recognise them.&#8221; She said they planned to go bigger next year with the help of sponsors.&#8220;We truly see this massive event continuing every year and getting bigger and better. To all participants, this is not a competition. Congratulations to all who took awards home and thank you so much for believing in this project. Never give up.&#8221;She added that women should help one another climb the career ladder. &#8220;Together we can reach the top,&#8221; concluded Makhushe.
