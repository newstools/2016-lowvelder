MBOMBELA &#8211; The licensing offices in the municipality&#8217;s jurisdiction were closed since last week due to a financial disagreement over payment procedures between the municipality and the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison. This resulted in the offices running out of paper. In July, the municipality experienced similar problems at its licensing offices.After four days of enquiries to CMLM, Lowvelder only heard from the spokesman, Mr Joseph Ngala, once the offices reopened at 12:00 yesterday.The challenges experienced in the past few days were as a result of outstanding debt owed to the department, amounting to R106 million,&#8221; he said.The municipality performs licensing services on behalf of the provincial department, and pays them a percentage of the fees customers pay them. A must-read: Licensing issues are driving motorists nutsNgala said a payment plan was agreed on by the two parties for the resumption of the service, but not before it caused mayhem.The newspaper was inundated with calls from frustrated motorists unable to obtain or renew licences, and car dealerships were also unable to process customers&#8217; licensing and registration documents. Mr Righardt Strauss from Nelspruit Multifranchise dealership, said the licensing offices being closed affects the standard of service he can deliver to his clients.&#8220;We&#8217;ve got customers who have bought new cars but are waiting for licensing and registration documents. It is frustrating,&#8221; Strauss said.In the meantime, the public was not informed of the cause for the delay. Signs on some of the office doors cited the system as being offline. One woman said she visited both the Hazyview and White River offices to try to renew her expired driver&#8217;s licence.&#8220;I was told by the security guard at the door that the system was offline. Although the Hazyview office looked open, the doors were kept closed,&#8221; she said.On Tuesday morning, the switchboard operator at Hazyview&#8217;s municipal offices, went as far as to say that the system had been offline since last Wednesday &#8211; due to an electricity outage.Also read: Licences cannot be issued due to paper shortageBack in Mbombela, Ms Matilda Strydom, was so desperate she was willing to drive to any town to have her documents processed.&#8220;When I went to the Riverside customer care centre in Mbombela, the offices were closed. There was no documentation whatsoever and no one at the counter. I also could not see a notice on the door informing the public of the problem,&#8221; Strydom said.&#8220;I went to the main Mbombela office and found the same situation. I was willing to drive through to a licensing office in a different town but I heard that all in the Lowveld area are affected. I need to sort our scooter transfer papers, an expired bakkie licence and clearance for my car.&#8221;We are all getting hot under the collar and it is not just the heat of the last few days.&#8221;Strydom had since returned to the Mbombela office on Wednesday and Thursday morning to find it still closed.
