MBOMBELA &#8211; City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) is in arrears with Eskom, but is doing everything it can to keep the lights on. The municipality has denied the possibility of bulk electricity cuts in January, despite a leaked Eskom notice stating the contrary.Spokesman for CMLM, Mr Joseph Ngala, says it has entered into a repayment agreement with the power utility to settle its R113,5-million account by December 2.A leaked internal Eskom document titled, &#8220;Notice of electricity supply interruptions in Mpumalanga local municipalities,&#8221; states that City of Mbombela is one of eight municipalities which has failed to adhere to the terms and conditions of its repayment agreement with the energy provider.Also read: Mbombela electricity to be cut due to Eskom debtAccording to the notice, &#8220;A number of municipalities in Mpumalanga are currently indebted to Eskom for the bulk supply of electricity. On November 16 the overdue amount stood at R2,4 billion. Eight of these municipalities are now in serious default and may be disconnected by January 23, 2017.&#8221;CMLM was listed as one, along with eMalahleni, eMakhazeni, Mkhondo, Chief Albert Luthuli, Msukaligwa, Lekwa and Dipaleseng.The power was proposed to be cut from 06:00 and 08:00 to from 17:00 to 19:30 on weekdays as well as 08:30 to 11:00 and 15:00 to 17:30 on weekends.Ngala said the municipality only entered into a repayment agreement with Eskom on November 16.&nbsp;We are not aware of any threat by Eskom to have electricity cut off in City of Mbombela. Our records, as sent by us to Eskom, reflect a different story as to what is purported in the notice you are referring to,&#8221; he said.Of the money owed to Eskom, R59,9 million is still in the 30-day payment period. R45,8 million is older than 60 days and R7,7 million has been due for longer, but fewer than 90 days. Lowvelder&#8217;s numerous attempts to reach the energy provider for comment have been unsuccessful.Also read: Municipality debt shuts down licensing officesMs Linda Grimbeek, chief operating officer at the Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism (KLCBT), told Lowvelder she had written confirmation from the municipality informing her that the electricity account was well managed.We have established that there is no threat of cuts. We at the KLCBT monitor the account very closely as interruption in power is one of the single biggest threats to the business community,&#8221; Grimbeek said.She emphasised that the business community would not allow an interruption in electricity.&#8220;We will make absolutely every effort to prevent a situation like this by working closely together with the municipality.&#8221;DA caucus leader, Mr Steve Schorman, said the financial impact of cuts would be devastating. &#8220;The effect on service delivery would be huge. The municipality generates so much of its income from electricity sales, the least the consumer can expect, is that the council pay its bills,&#8221; he said.
