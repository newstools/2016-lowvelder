MBOMBELA &#8211; Mr Eric Ball lost his entire life savings and pension in the late &#8217;90s. He almost lost the money he had managed to save since then earlier this year to Opteck, a binary-trading broker. Ball tried to obtain a book on binary trading via the website opteck.com, and was contacted by the company. It prompted him to give his MasterCard information. He gave it, thinking it would go towards paying for the book. Only later did he realise that the book was supposed to be free.
