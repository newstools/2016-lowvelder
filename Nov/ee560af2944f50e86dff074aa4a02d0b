MBOMBELA &#8211; The Mpumalanga Gambling Board (MGB) is serious about eradicating illegal gambling and said this practice has infiltrated the gambling environment at the expense of legalised gambling operations.On Friday November 4 the board destroyed 45 illegal gambling machines in the city. It said the use of illegal gambling machines has increased throughout the province.&#8220;The machines, the majority of which are Chinese roulette, or 50-cent machines as popularly known among the public, were confiscated following a number of investigations conducted by the MGB,&#8221; said CEO, Mr Bheki Mlambo.Also read: Six do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of safe gambling The machines were not licensed by the board, and have been submitted to laboratory testing and certification by the standards authority. As a result they could not be allowed for public use.The board said the machines had the potential to pose health risks and to cheat unsuspecting members of the public out of their hard-earned money.&#8220;We appeal to members of the public not to fall prey to illicit operators that sell illegal gambling machines or offer any form of gambling without a valid gambling licence, which must always be on display at gambling venues,&#8221; said Mlambo.Also read: Board dismantles illegal gambling machines According to him, illegal operators undermine government&#8217;s efforts of balancing the social costs and benefits of gambling through licensing.The board said the destroyed machines had been used as evidence in court cases.Mlambo said they would continue to monitor any location that might be using these illegal devices. It urged those still in possession of illegal gambling machines to withdraw them from public consumption in order to avoid prosecution.Other illegal gambling activities that the public needs to be aware of and refrain from, include gambling on the Internet, fahfee (Mo-china) and any betting at locations or venues without a licence.To report any illegal gambling activities or to ascertain the legality of gambling activities and gambling venues in your area, please contact the Mpumalanga Gambling Board on 013-750-8000.
