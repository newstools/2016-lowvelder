MBOMBELA &#8211; It was a picture taken amid the flying bullets and the fleeing children of the Soweto uprisings.It was the image of a dying Hector Pieterson in the arms of Mbuyisa Makhubo, running, his face is twisted in grief while Hector&#8217;s sister, Antoinette, runs beside him hysterically.It was a print which would catapult him to sudden fame and end his photojournalism career.The iconic photograph of a dying Hector Pieterson during the Soweto uprisings of 1976.The 13-year-old Hector would become the face of the uprisings and the iconic photograph would be distributed to wire agencies around the world after being published in The World, the paper Nzima worked for.Also read: Iconic photographer honours MadibaOn November 11 Nzima, also known as &#8220;Bra Sam&#8221;, was honoured with a lifetime achiever award at the Vodacom Journalist of the Year Awards for his significant contribution to the media in South Africa.Nzima says he thought he was only invited to attend the occasion in Johannesburg, not that he would win such a prestigious award.&#8220;It was such an honour just to be invited. At the end of the evening, once all the other awards were announced, I saw the photographs I took on that historical day projected onto the screen.&#8221;I was so shocked, I couldn&#8217;t help but cry. The hall was packed with the best journalists from around the country, yet I was in the spotlight,&#8221; he tells Lowvelder.&#8220;I took the photo as a journalist. I was just doing my job. After taking that picture, my life changed altogether and for the worst; it was like a horror. I resigned from the newspaper and moved back to Bushbuckridge where I had grown up and thought I would be safe.&#8221;He says he originally regretted taking the picture and the frustration he had caused the apartheid government.&#8220;But it was a photo which made me famous in South Africa and around the world and there was no taking it back. I feared for my life at the time. Police had been told that if they found me, they should shoot me. They would say it was a stray bullet. I had to choose between my life and my career as a journalist. I said I am choosing my life,&#8221; Nzima adds.He says the police found him in Bushbuckridge. Three detectives arrived in plain clothes at the bottle store he was running to make a living. They warned him not to make trouble like he had made in Soweto and put him under house arrest.&#8220;They used to come sporadically on the weekends to check up on me until one day, they just stopped coming. Maybe they decided I was no longer a threat. Now 40 years later, I am receiving recognition for what I did and it feels like a kind of consolation.&#8221;Also read: University of Mpumalanga students make new demands &nbsp;Nzima does not agree with the direction the current Fees Must Fall movement is going.&#8220;The young people of today are far different to the youth of 1976. On June 16 there was a peaceful march organised by schoolgoers to hand a memorandum to the Department of Education. The police shot at those students with live ammunition and that is what provoked the violence.What today&#8217;s youth do not understand is that the changing of everything is a process. They want an answer immediately. They are putting the government under pressure to say yes now by stoning innocent people&#8217;s cars, destroying libraries and looting shops,&#8221; he says.Sam Nzima is currently putting together a collection of photographs of black cultures and traditions. Here is Metthews Mhlaba, in traditional Xitsonga dress.&#8220;After Fees Must Fall has fallen, where will those students go to school or learn? Free education is necessary in this country, I agree, but it cannot be done in this way. If the government gives in to their demands now, every time they want something, they will just burn and destroy infrastructure. They must sit down and negotiate, not fight with force.&#8221;He believes too that press freedom is alive and well in South Africa.&#8220;In the early 1970s, we were not allowed to take a photograph within 100 metres of a magistrate&#8217;s court or a police station. Now, photographers can capture certain images in the courtrooms. Freedom of expression can also be seen in our cartoonists&#8217; work. That would never have been allowed in the old days.&#8221;Bra Sam is taking photos once more and is working on a compilation of photographs which he hopes to put into a book in the near future.&#8220;I am making a collection of historical things to preserve the cultures of this country. Our culture is disappearing; western civilisation is taking over and destroying black cultures. I am taking pictures of all people&#8217;s traditional dress, the way they dance and eat and their social gatherings.It will be a record of cultures which people can look back on to see what life was once like in this diverse country.&#8221;Meanwhile, Nzima&#8217;s well-known image was chosen by Time magazine for its book, 100 Photographs: The Most Influential Images of All Time, which was launched yesterday.He says he is disappointed that he was not be able to attend the prestigious event due to the invite being sent at such short notice and the magazine not having the budget to pay for his costs.&#8220;I just can&#8217;t believe that my picture has been included in the book. They tell me it is in the top 10 pictures of all time,&#8221; he says with a smile.
