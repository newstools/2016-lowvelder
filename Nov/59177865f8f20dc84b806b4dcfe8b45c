MBOMBELA &#8211; Police are investigating the deaths of three men under unusual or unknown circumstances. A labourer of a transport company died in a freak accident on Friday when an asbestos pipe fell on him at a site near Brondal.Police spokesman, Capt Dawie Pretorius, explained that a truck from Johannesburg was making a delivery. It had a full load of asbestos pipes. The man, who was helping to offload the pipes, was standing on the truck on top of the pipes when he slipped and fell onto the ground. A loose pipe rolled off the truck onto him, killing him instantly.According to Netcare911 spokesman, Ms Athlenda Mathe, paramedics declared the man dead on the scene. On the same day, two decomposing bodies were discovered in different areas of the city by members of the public. The body of a man estimated to be in his mid-50s was found near Village Shopping Centre. It is believed the man was homeless and lived in the veld.Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit&#8217;s response manager, Mr Callum MacPherson, said their control room received a call at approximately midday from a passer-by who had made the discovery. &#8220;The body was found in a vlei in what looked like a makeshift bed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It looked as though he died in his sleep. His body was already starting to decompose. It will be for police to determine the cause and time of death,&#8221; he added.Later in the afternoon, the badly decomposed body of another man was discovered near the railway line in the Vintonia area by a passer-by relieving himself in the bushes. Pretorius said it looked as though it had been there for more than two weeks. &#8220;We are surprised that it took so long to be reported as the smell in the heat was unbearable,&#8221; he said. Police have opened inquest dockets into all three deaths.Read more here: Murder case opened after bloodied body found
