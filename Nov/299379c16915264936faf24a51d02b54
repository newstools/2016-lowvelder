MBOMBELA &#8211; The Paws @ Penryn dog walk will take place on Sunday, November 27, on the school grounds, and promises to &#8220;leave your dog with happy paws&#8221;. All proceeds from the event will go towards the SPCA&#8217;s bill at Van Wijk Street Animal Hospital. There will also be free rabies shots provided by SPCA Nelspruit.Ten-year-olds, Caitlyn Nel and Kayla Kirton, took their idea of doing something to help the animals to their class teacher, Ms Gina Eva, after the SPCA came to speak to the pupils during an assembly.Also read: Nelspruit SPCA in dire need of financial help&#8220;We nagged Ms Eva a lot. We thought we could bring Kayla&#8217;s passion for rhino conservation and my hope to help the SPCA together,&#8221; Caitlyn told Lowvelder.Eva said it has been so refreshing to see how her whole class has come on board to help Caitlyn and Kayla.&#8220;At the school, there is a big sense of giving back to the community and all pupils are conscious of reaching out to help. Seeing the passion from the kids has been wonderful,&#8221; she said.I have also been able to link the initiative with a lot of our lessons. We have designed pamphlets and written newspaper articles about the dog walk. Next week, the grade fours will present their oral examinations on animals in need. It has been such fun and so informative.&#8221;Eva added that the SPCA has been most helpful in the organisation of the event at such short notice, and that the other grade four class has also been involved and will be helping to man the tables along the four-kilometre route.Also watch: This dog is not too great at hide and seekThere will be water points, a dog-treats table, a stop where one take a selfie with one&#8217;s dog (A K9E), a grooming area for nail clipping and beautification and a certificate table where dogs will be able to stamp their unique paw print.Some of the pupils will also be on &#8220;poop scoop&#8221; duty. Vouchers and prizes will also be up for grabs.Each dog will get a prize on the day, only the dogs, not the humans,&#8221; Kayla explained.Entrance fee is R50 per dog and R10 per human. Registration will be staggered from 07:30 to 08:30 to avoid large crowds of dogs and owners starting the walk at once.For more information about Paws @ Penryn or how you can get involved, contact Gina Eva on 071-348-9153 or Sharon Nel on 084-675-6965.
