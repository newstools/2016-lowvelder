MBOMBELA &#8211; Less consumption, more investment, was one of the main decisions reiterated by finance MEC, Mr Sikhumbuzo Eric Kholwane, during his adjustment of the provincial government&#8217;s budget on Friday.He added that the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) and Mpumalanga Economic Growth Agency (MEGA) will continue to be weaned off taxpayers&#8217; money for their operations, &#8220;as the public entities are supposed to be self-sufficient&#8221;.Kholwane announced a reduction of funding of about R3 million each, during the main appropriation at the beginning of the financial year.&#8220;We are no longer going to feed them,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The MTPA has the necessary help now, it has a solid board and a CEO will be appointed soon. If it focuses, it can generate revenue.&#8220;We are not looking back. They can no longer use taxpayers&#8217; money to do what they are supposed to do.&#8220;Our message is that we are going to reduce it. We must not help them by feeding them. That dependency will lead to obesity. We must rather teach the child to exercise.&#8221;Social development had R18 million taken away from its allocation, from projects on which it would not spend its allocation before the end of the financial year.&#8220;We cannot leave the funds there. We took a firm decision that no department will get rollovers, except for national grants because we have no authority over these. The rest we have reprioritised to infrastructure,&#8221; Kholwane explained.The Office of the Premier received an additional R18 million &#8220;to enhance the system of public accountability&#8221; for investigative functions including a hotline where the public can report problems with a department. The litigation against all departments has also been centralised in the Office of the Premier.Water and electricity as well as sport were the other big winners in the adjustment.Human settlements received an additional R157,7 million, of which R155,6 million is to address bulk water and sanitation. Cooperative governance got an additional R118,5 million for electrification projects, implements for traditional leaders, and taking over project Vuka Sisebente from the Office of the Premier.The provincial schools sport league was bolstered with an additional R20,5 million. In total the Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation received R45,6 million more for the upgrade of a range of sport facilities in the province.Kholwane explained the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport&#8217;s reduction of R47,2 million came about after it had reprioritised R43,6 million from goods and services in the department to road construction.Health&#8217;s decrease of R35,8 million went to the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison (DCSSL), for providing security services at health facilities. DCSSL&#8217;s increase totalled R112,4 million.Kholwane announced that the Mpumalanga Gambling Board (MGB) and Mpumalanga Liqour Authority (MLA) are to be merged.A study has been conducted and a team has been appointed to merge the two, to establish a multi-purpose regulator for all economic activity in the province.&#8220;The report suggests weaknesses in our internal controls. It is sensitive. We are going to act on it.&#8221;He wouldn&#8217;t say whether any employees were implicated in the theft, as it was a criminal matter.&#8220;If our employees are not there, the police could not build a case against them.&#8221;The case against the four men arrested for the theft, was withdrawn in September.
