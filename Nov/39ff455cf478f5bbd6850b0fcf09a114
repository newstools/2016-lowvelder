MBOMBELA &#8211; It is emotionally and financially draining having one child born with special needs. Mr Huey and Ms Petru Potgieter have two. Xerxes (2) has Down&#8217;s syndrome and Cyrus (4) needs an operation they cannot afford. Chirpy Nursery School principal, Ms Linda Roets, has been so touched by this couple&#8217;s plight that she contacted Lowvelder to request help.The family lives in a moderate home in Sonheuwel, which is sparsely furnished &#8211; to be child-friendly. Petru explained how Cyrus was born with amblyopia in one of his eyes, commonly known as &#8220;lazy eye&#8221;. &#8220;When he was born the doctor told us he would have to have an operation every two years.&#8221;
