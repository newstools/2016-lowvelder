Huntington dam.MBOMBELA &#8211; Mr Paul de Bruyn is the man behind the Water Restoration Programme which aims to restore 100 of the strongest boreholes in rural communities within a 100-kilometre radius of White River.He has been working to develop and galvanise rural Lowveld communities for 20 years; be it regarding food security, land rights or water-irrigation projects. There are too many initiatives to mention.Now, as South Africa is experiencing one of its worst droughts in living history, he is focusing on the dire need for water and farming-related infrastructure.According to De Bruyn, &#8220;there are 500 boreholes located in these areas, of which 400 have not been working for many years. And it is reckoned that almost half the people living in these areas are undernourished&#8221;.On average, he estimates it would cost R35 000 to refurbish each borehole.Also read: Water shortages on the cards if it doesn t rainDe Bruyn&#8217;s Pala Forerunners, in partnership with other community organisations, hopes to complete the project in 18 months. For that to happen, they will need substantial support.De Bruyn says that similar initiatives by Pala Forerunners in the past have enabled the planting of 50 000 fresh vegetable plants per repaired borehole, per month.&#8220;That equates to a potential 60 million plants per year across the 100 refurbished boreholes. At a conservative yield of R7 per plant, that amounts to R420 million per annum in much-needed nutrition and food security that will be produced directly by the participants,&#8221; he explains.De Bruyn drives to communities to deliver seedlings at a minimal cost and to speak to people one-on-one about the changes they would like to see in their surroundings.&#8220;If there is one thing that would make your heart sing, what would it be?&#8221; he asks.He emphasises, however, that the greatest returns by far &#8220;occur in the hearts and minds of the participants&#8221; and with the restoration of hope and dignity among the people who are empowered to take meaningful control of their lives.&#8220;They can better look after their family members&#8217; well-being as well as the more vulnerable members of the community; the orphans and children, the elderly, the bedridden and the disabled,&#8221; De Bruyn says.I cannot put into words the experience of seeing community members when a borehole is fixed. They know the water is there, and yet, they cannot get to it. When the water comes, it&#8217;s like it undoes the handcuffs.&#8221;Also read: Water wasted as restrictions are not enforcedHe tells another story of a group of community members from Huntington, close to KNP&#8217;s Paul Kruger Gate, who, in 2002, built a dam using just wheelbarrows and shovels.&#8220;They wanted to start an irrigation farm for vegetables to ensure food security and income for themselves and their families,&#8221; he says. Mr Dries van Wyk, general manager of Lisbon Estates at the time, saw the dam required reinforcing and provided the necessary earth-moving equipment to do so, explains De Bruyn.When the first rains came, the dam filled and the community members, mainly elderly women, started farming. Today, there are more than 10 hectares of fresh vegetables growing near the dam.Unfortunately, the dam wall has been compromised and needs repair. De Bruyn says Van Wyk and other parties have come to the rescue to offer advice and sponsorship of equipment, although there is more help needed.&#8220;Individuals and companies have been incredible in offering support to this project. The benefits show when you visit community heroes like Joyce Mnisi and her team who feed 175 children at Thinasonke Drop-in Centre in Bushbuckridge District and the irrigation farmers of Huntington. You should see the amazing hearts in these communities,&#8221; De Bruyn says with a smile.Everyone should come and see the great things that are happening.&#8221;*The Water Restoration Programme aims to raise R3,5 million locally and internationally through trust foundations, charities and community-service organisations for the first phase of the programme. By the end of November, the sites which are currently being worked on in Huntington, Vurhonga and Tiyimiseleni, will enable the irrigation of 20 hectares of vegetables.If you would like to find out more about the programme or join the initiative in the field, contact Mr Paul de Bruyn on 082-677-6310 or paul.debruyn@live.co.uk.Before: Huntington farmlands.After: Huntington farmland&#8217;s 10 hectares of vegetables.
