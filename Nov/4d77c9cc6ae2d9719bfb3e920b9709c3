MBOMBELA &#8211; Kwena Dam, near Lydenburg, is now at under 20 per cent capacity and the recent rains will have made no difference, according to water provider Sembcorp Silulumanzi.The company is also concerned about the 2017 dry season, &#8220;which for all intents and purposes could be worse than 2016&#8243;.Mbombela, some parts of White River, South Nsikazi up to KaBokweni, and Matsulu, are all supplied by abstraction from the Crocodile River, which is in turn, supplied by releases from the Kwena Dam during the dry season.Mr Richmond Jele, spokesman for Sembcorp Silulumanzi, said rain was needed. &#8220;Downstream rain will assist the run-off in the river but for the dam to fill up, it should rain in the vicinity of Dullstroom and Lydenburg,&#8221; he said.He added that it was dangerous to predict how much longer the water supply would last due to the unpredictability of weather forecasting.&#8220;We are using a statistical prediction model on historical dam levels to assist with planning purposes as well as the medium-term rolling three-month forecasts by the South African Weather Service (SAWS),&#8221; Jele explained.&#8220;This indicates that the Kwena Dam level will be very low towards the end of 2016. The percentage rise during the 2016/17 summer season depends on the amount of rain in the catchment. Should we have a normal rainy season, the dam could rise by 30 to 40 per cent, but the question remains &#8211; are we going to get through the 2017 dry season?&#8221;He added that if the dam level should drop to 10 per cent, agricultural use of the water, which is already severely restricted, would most likely be stopped.Also read: Water shortages on the cards if it doesn t rainIn a recent letter to customers, Sembcorp Silulumanzi urged water users to be water wise by reporting any leaks immediately and not watering gardens or cleaning pavements.&#8220;While some customers have heeded the call to reduce water wastage and usage, there are still some who continue to misuse water and others who resort to making an illegal bypass of their water meter in order to avoid high bills and penalties,&#8221; the letter read.Jele emphasised that Kwena Dam continued to drop by an average percentage point per week.If people &#8216;steal&#8217; water, they should be aware that they are only stealing from themselves and everybody will be affected adversely, should the dam run dry by next year.&#8220;It is only if we work together that we may survive this drought and explore other mechanisms to mitigate this in the immediate future,&#8221; he told Lowvelder.The Lowveld region received up to 13 and 15 millimetres in Barberton and Graskop respectively, according to the latest daily rainfall statistics on the SAWS website. Fourteen millimetres were measured in Mbombela.Also read: Extreme heat aggravates droughtForecaster, Ms Vanetia Phakula, said the Lowveld can expect a 30 per cent chance of afternoon thunder showers over the next three days, with temperatures remaining relatively warm.According to a source at Mpumalanga Provincial Disaster Management who did not want to be identified, the rain over the past few days has provided light relief from the recent heat and had a slight domestic impact on gardens and farms.&#8220;We are not, however, at saturation point which means the rain has not penetrated yet. Although we are grateful for whatever rain we get, we will need at least 100 millimetres to make a significant difference to the water basins (reservoirs and dams),&#8221; the source said. The levels of most of the region&#8217;s main dams have dropped by two per cent or more over the past two weeks.Dr Eddie Riddell, manager of water resources in the Kruger National Park (KNP), agreed the dams were reaching a critical condition and that the big rainfall of the season needed to start. &#8220;We have only had three or four millimetres of rainfall in Skukuza over the past three days. We will need in the region of 10 to 20 millimetres.&#8221;The City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) has converted previously approved voluntary water restrictions to offences. These apply to residential, business, industrial and government customers, in line with the Water Services Act.The washing of vehicles and hard surfaces, irrigation of gardens, filling up of swimming pools and operation of water features carry a fine of between R750 and R1 500 for first offenders, and up to R6 000 for third-time offenders.According to spokesman for the municipality, Mr Joseph Ngala, no one has been fined to date.Lowvelder readers reported know how much rain they measured in their gardens on Tuesday and Wednesday: Mbombela West Acres &#8211; between 14 and 17 millimetres Sonpark &#8211; 18 millimetres Steiltes &#8211; 12 millimetres Ngodwana &#8211; between 32 and 45 millimetres Cairn &#8211; 15 millimetres Lydenburg &#8211; 8 millimetres Primkop Dam area &#8211; 11,5 millimetres
