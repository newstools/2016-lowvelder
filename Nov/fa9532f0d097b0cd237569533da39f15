HAZYVIEW &#8211; A joint operation between a number of security companies, the police and members of the community led to the arrest of 10 men on Friday. It is believed the men were responsible for a farm attack in the Lydenburg/Stofberg area in the early hours of Friday morning. The victims, Mr Eep (46), Ms Surina (44), Ms Marinda (22) and Mr Christo Coetser (20) were tied up during the ordeal. They were only able to free themselves after about two hours and sought help from their neighbours. They were later treated for minor knife wounds at Middelburg Hospital, and were discharged the same day. Provincial police spokesman, Sgt Gerald Sedibe, said they received a tip-off and lay in wait around Perry&#8217;s Bridge. At about 09:30, the first four, travelling in an Audi believed to have been stolen during the farm attack, were apprehended. Shortly afterwards, another four travelling in a rented Volkswagen Polo were arrested in the same area. One of the suspects was shot in a leg during a shoot-out which ensued at the Hazyview/Sabie intersection, before being arrested. Another suspect, travelling in an Opel Corsa bakkie, was detained near Casa do Sol. The final suspect was apparently arrested in Stoffberg. Goods, including firearms and laptops and an undisclosed amount of cash, believed to have been stolen during the farm attack, were found in their possession, confirmed Sedibe. &#8220;We have good reason to believe that all suspects in Friday&#8217;s attack were arrested,&#8221; Mr Albert Gryvenstein of Bossies Community Justice, said. The men were expected to appear in court yesterday, but at the time of going to press the outcome was not yet known.Also read: 14 arrests a KNP success
