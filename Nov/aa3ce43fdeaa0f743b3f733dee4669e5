WHITE RIVER &#8211; Ms Amy Ernst (24), a dancer originally from White River, recently tore the ligaments in her right knee.At the young age of eight she started belly dancing after hearing Egyptian music for the first time. After school, Ernst studied English and Drama at Rhodes University. From there she landed on international film sets in Cape Town, where she was an extra in Black Mirror and was a body double for Mila Jovovich in the sixth installment of Resident Evil.&#8220;I always wanted to be an actress, but there is a drug culture within the film industry and some things that I just didn&#8217;t want to be exposed to. I decided to pursue dancing as a full-time career,&#8221; she told Lowvelder.The dancer and her mother recently used all their savings to purchase a home, with a dance studio, in Johannesburg. The idea was to relocate at the end of October and for Ernst to start giving dance lessons while performing in Johannesburg. Unfortunately, the entire plan was put on hold by her injury.On the morning of October 19 Ernst was seriously injured during her morning dance routine. &#8220;It happened at around 05:00. I was doing a turn, and my foot got caught: it was facing forward, but my knee went to the right. I fell, and tore the ligament in my knee. The part that keeps my leg from going into an unnaturally straight position is gone,&#8221; she explained.At Mediclinic Nelspruit her doctor confirmed her injury and determined that Ernst would need arthroscopic knee surgery. &#8220;It is a very delicate operation. They would need to put a camera inside my knee.&#8221;After the MRI scans and diagnosis was done, her doctor noted that she would not be able to have the surgery done for another 10 days, as the swelling needed to go down first.According to Ernst, her medical aid scheme, Discovery Health, would cover the surgery since it was an emergency, but when she didn&#8217;t have it done immediately, it no longer considered it an emergency and refused to cover any costs.Her doctor wrote to Discovery, but it still refused to cover the hospital fees &#8211; even if she were to pay for the surgery herself.The letter Ernst received from the medical aid confirmed that she was a KeyCare Plus member. According to the Discovery Health website, they &#8220;pay for ongoing intensive day-to-day care for specific trauma events, and unlimited cover in the KeyCare Hospital Network. There is a list of procedures that are only covered in the KeyCare day surgery network.&#8221;Ms Celeste du Plessis, head of benefits at Discovery Health, confirmed that Ernst was a member of the KeyCare Plan. &#8220;This is the lowest cost and lowest benefit option on the medical scheme. Unfortunately, knee surgery is not covered on this plan, although it is covered on every other plan in the Discovery Health Medical Scheme. Ms Ernst may want to consider upgrading her plan from the beginning of next year in order to be covered for this treatment. We would advise her to discuss these options with her financial advisor who would be best placed to advise her on this matter,&#8221; she said.Ms Khensani Mthombeni from Discovery Health&#8217;s media relations replied with, &#8220;Note that there is a life-insurance product called the income-protection benefit that caters for when people get injured and cannot work anymore. This would have covered her.&#8221;After the surgery, Ernst would not be able to dance for six months, but she has found another way to keep head above water until she is back on her feet, so to speak. &#8220;I tutor children in English. I studied English, and right now I do what I have to do,&#8221; she said.&#8220;November to February, that is where I would have made back all the money it cost me to buy the new studio. I can handle this setback, but I need help.&#8221;The surgeon has offered to perform the surgery pro bono, but Ernst still needs to raise R60 000 towards the hospital fees.&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t ask this if it was not my last hope. Please help me get my life back.&#8221;Enquiries: Ms Amy Ernst on076-591-7690.If you feel like helping both Amy and the elderly, read more: Wishlist for Seniors in trouble
