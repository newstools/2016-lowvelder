He said he is only aware of the postponement and nothing more.Also see: PREVIEW: Golfer beaten up on Nelspruit golf courseMabilane confirmed that his lawyer was out of the country on the day of the disciplinary and sent a junior representative with him to the meeting.When we arrived, we found that the four men wanted to negotiate instead of proceeding. It seemed they wanted to settle the matter internally. My representative said we would not be able to make a decision like that without consulting my lawyer. They gave us no advanced warning of their plans,&#8221; he said.Mabilane opened a case against the group of men who allegedly beat him up on the course nearly a month ago. Until the outcome of the inquiry, all five members remain suspended. |Mabilane is upset about his suspension as he does not feel the club is doing the right thing.They should be making a statement and acting on discrimination. Instead they refuse to say that and suspend me? I don&#8217;t get that,&#8221; he told Lowvelder.&#8220;I cannot practice and it affects me obviously as I hope to make golf my career.&#8221;The case has been sent by the SAPS to the senior public prosecutor for a decision. No charges have been laid and no arrests have been made as yet. The names of the four alleged attackers have not been made known.Also read: How racist is the Lowveld?In a press statement released by the club after the incident, Plumb confirmed the matter was under investigation by the SAPS.&#8220;The club, through its management committee, shall take steps against any person, be it a member, visitor, staff and/or caddy, if such a person is found to be part of such allegations and tarnish the name of the club or its members and staff,&#8221; he added.
