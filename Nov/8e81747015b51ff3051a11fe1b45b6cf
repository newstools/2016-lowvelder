MBOMBELA &#8211; After more than 35 years of working as a domestic worker, Thelma Manana says she has found a second family in her workplace. Thelma is an awe-inspiring woman whose sweet voice commands respect and a parental air, yet she oozes modesty. She knows how to make visitors feel welcome, and when she calls one by name, the rest is umntwana wam (my child). Perhaps owing to her beautiful, deep smile, talking to her feels like talking to a favourite aunt.That&#8217;s probably because other than her son, she has raised more than five other kids where she has worked before. &#8220;It comes natural, you develop this sense of parental love. The feeling is beautiful,&#8221; she said.
