STELLENBOSCH &#8211; The first 1 000 days of a child s life hold the key to health and intellectual development.Development at a physical, intellectual and emotional level occurs the fastest from the commencement of pregnancy until the child s second birthday.During this period the brain expands by 80%, says Prof Mariana Kruger, Executive Head of the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.However, in South Africa many children are denied the right to the best care during this period.The resulting negative chain reaction resonates until adulthood, as well as in the community as a whole: Chronic malnutrition results in poor brain development, which in turn causes poor school performance and could eventually result in lifelong poverty, Kruger explains.Malnutrition does not necessarily go hand in hand with poverty. This is proven by the fact that countries like South Africa, Botswana and Mexico with a relative higher national wealth do not perform well in this regard, in contrast to countries like Malawi, Madagascar and Peru.In South Africa several challenges have to be overcome and focus areas have to be developed. Little guidance is provided regarding birth control and family planning, Kruger says. Effective birth control is necessary to prevent children in poor families from being born too close to one another. Furthermore, birth control and family planning clinics are attended poorly. Ignorance, distance and cost play a huge part in this regard, since women have to take a day off from work to get there and are sometimes sent away because they arrive on the wrong day.In the first 1 000 days, the health worker is often the portal to information about improved nutrition for mother and child, hygiene and curable diseases like diarrhoea.Exclusive breastfeeding is the single most important step for infant survival during the first six months after birth, Kruger emphasises.In fact, in developing countries such infants will have a six times higher chance of survival than children who are not breast-fed.However, the AIDS pandemic in South Africa, coupled with fear that the HI virus can be transmitted from mother to child, contributed to breast-feeding being moved to the back-burner to a large extent.Because the government provided alternative feeding for a long time, the misperception was established that that is the way things should be done. The view even developed that the rich do things in that way, Kruger explains.After the first six months the infant requires access to balanced feeding.Kruger emphasises that health cannot be observed in isolation. If we wish to save a child in his first 1 000 days, it is not only about survival, but also about development and learning. We have only succeeded if we develop a child into a self-reliant individual who eventually finds a job and is able to keep it.&#8221;&nbsp;
