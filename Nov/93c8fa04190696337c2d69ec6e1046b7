MBOMBELA &#8211; Local investors who put money into a holiday development in Mozambique have little to show for it, years after Bazaruto Island View Estate (BIVE) in Vilanculos was meant to start with development.Lowvelder began investigating the upmarket holiday development after several people voiced their concerns to the newspaper about the business deals of BIVE. An empty piece of land with a few half-built brick walls is a far cry from the island-style development they saw on brochures.Mr Ettiene Erasmus of BIVE claims he has been struggling to get the development off the ground due to false perceptions of conflict in Mozambique, but questions have been raised about the legality of the development as well as promises made to investors.Attempts to verify Erasmus as the legal owner of the property in Mozambique have not been successful and he has not been forthcoming about his ownership of the property.On BIVE&#8217;s official website, Erasmus claims that 70 per cent of the 146 stands for holiday homes on the development have been secured by investors. He confirmed this during an interview with Lowvelder last Thursday.Erasmus started selling stands on the development in 2009, although he admitted that he only obtained the relevant rights and approvals in 2012.Promises made include the approval of funding for the rest of the development, which would include a holiday resort, medical facility and offices, among others.According to an undated marketing document from BIVE, the first phase would comprise 146 holiday homes and a holiday resort, including a five-star hotel. A stand on this &#8220;piece of paradise&#8221; sells for R250 000.Phase two of the development, consisting of a crafts market, luxury homes and medical facility, would be done within 24 to 36 months. A lakeside lodge, business centre and office, as well as cultural village were to follow in 30 to 48 months.On the Facebook page for Mozambique Properties, housing rentals and sales in &#8220;this exotic destination&#8221; are advertised as follows: &#8220;Now you can have certainty, surety and confidence on the growth and returns of your investment,&#8221; with promises of returns on investment of 20 per cent interest per year made as recently as October 19. Other promises made in marketing material include a doubling of investment. But investors who have entrusted their money to Erasmus, don&#8217;t share his enthusiasm.Read all about the questionable land deals, investor&#8217;s experiences and empty promises here:
