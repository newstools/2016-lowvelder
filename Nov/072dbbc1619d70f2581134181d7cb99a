MBOMBELA- The South African Council for Business Women had its third annual Corporate Quest on November 11. This year s event had fewer teams than the last, but it does not mean it was any less spectacular!This year, there was also a healthy presence of men in every team, showing that men too can support the cause. The day s event had eight colourful teams carting all over town, completing different tasks at every location getting clues as to go to where the next location would be. Cutting and pasting pictures from newspapers, searching stores, singing a jingle or guessing songs were some of the things each team each team had to do in order to complete the race.The team-members were a combination of family members and friends, and members from different companies would work together, and for some, this was not their first Corporate Quest. Burnette Wagner, winner of the Spirit award last year, came back once more, only to lead her team, Team Captain to victory.The winners were announced at The Lapa Pub, where the after party was held.For a reminder of last year s event, click here: SACBW Corporate Quest 2015The stop locations for this year were:Lowveld Media, Extreme Signs, Limetime Shuttle and Radio Laeveld at Sonpark, Swift Group s office, Mica and Property Investment Corporation at Crossings, Ford, Emnotweni Sun and Supaquick at Riverside, Bagdad in White River and The Lapa Pub (end point) This year&#8217;s winners are:Best activity: Team Captains: Burnette Wagner, Neels Kemp, Megan Kemp, Adriana De Bruyn.Team Spirit: Bow Chicka Wow Wow: Angie Louw, L verne Wagner, Mildri Ferreira.Most difficult stop went to: Swift Group.
