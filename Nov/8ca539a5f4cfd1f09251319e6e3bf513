If you are travelling by plane Weigh your suitcase before you leave home to make sure you are under the weight limit. Also leave space for souvenirs and things you buy during your trip. Roll your clothes rather than packing them flat, it saves space and causes fewer creases. Keep your manicure set in your checked-in luggage, there will be no filing of nails on the plane. Try packing the least amount of accessories and shoes as possible. Bulky shoes and heavy bangles take up unnecessary space and weight. Check the weather ahead of time so your outfit can match conditions where you depart and arrive. Do not get caught up in a Cape Town storm in yoga pants and a tank top because you did not think of taking a Drimac with you. Always have clean underwear and an outfit in your hand luggage, so you do not have worries, should your luggage go missing. Keep your wallet, money and travelling documents on your person, preferably on your front, rather than in a bag on the side or on your back, to avoid being pickpocketed.If you are going to the beach Remember sunscreen as well as a freeze gel, as forgetting to put on sunscreen will result in a need for the latter. Check the weather before you go, you might be ready for the beach, but it may not be ready for you. Pack for any weather. Take an all-in-one shampoo and body wash to rinse off the sticky saltwater at the beach showers Take water bottles with you to keep you hydrated, freeze them so they stay cool for longer.If you are going to the bush The same rules can apply for the bush as for the beach. Take mosquito repellents and citronella-oil products. Take a first-aid kit, you may be a very long way from a pharmacy or doctor. Take snacks that do not necessarily need to be refrigerated, and can take some heat. Take comfortable clothing, the bush is no place for tight jeans, stilettos or square-point shoes.If you want some tips on wine pairing, read: Wine pairing ideas for the holidays
