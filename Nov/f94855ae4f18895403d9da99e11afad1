The 14th annual National Business Convention was held at Emperor&#8217;s Palace recently. Dr. Mathews Phosa was a keynote speaker. Here was his speech:Esteemed leaders of industry and business, Fellow South Africans, Ladies and gentlemen.South Africa s Constitution is based on a hard-fought for democracy, built on the political freedoms to which all South Africans have contributed so much.We often overlook the contributions of others, the individuals and parties that have contributed to the development of the Freedom Charter, people like Zachariah ZK Matthews, a Professor at the South African Native College later renamed the University of Fort Hare who proposed the drawing up of the Freedom Charter, whose main objective would be to instill political consciousness in the people and encourage their political activity.We should equally remember and thank all of those that went to the ballot boxes, casting their vote for the abolishment of Apartheid and the ultimate establishment of a free South Africa in 1994.Our Constitution gave all South Africans, black or white, equal rights to the riches, opportunities and challenges of our country. The Constitution also provides the same rights, opportunities and obligations to those that became citizens of our country yesterday and today, and to those individuals that will meet the conditions of citizenship in the future.READ MORE: Dr Mathews Phosa expects ANC to lose power in many municipalitiesThe past twenty-two years, since the dawn of our democracy, has proven to be quite a bumpy ride.South Africa is not a country in isolation. We must realize that the world is ever changing and that we must adapt or be left behind. The future challenges are manifold with global policy uncertainty impacting on our own often short-term policy decisions.8. To prosper, we must navigate a global village wherein Britain is squabbling about their desire to exit the European Union on their terms, and wherein, inexplicably, there seems to be movement to the political right.And at home, without fail, every day, when I open the newspaper, switch the television on or read the news on my phone, at least one article deals with corruption, state capture or calls for our President to resign his position.We focus on issues such as a short-lived fraud case against the Minister of Finance, Nkandla, state capture, a private aircraft landing at a national key point, our Government s reluctance to uphold its obligations to the International Criminal Court and allegations of nepotism, cronyism and personal enrichment, to name but a few.The people of South Africa are tired. We want change, we want rent-seeking leaders to vacate their offices and allow us to keep our word on the promises in the Freedom Charter.What often goes unnoticed, obscured by these corrupt practices already referred to, is the real state of affairs, or burning issues, in our country.Our State-Owned Enterprises are in trouble. Assets are being looted for private interest, Boards are in cahoots with their corrupt leaders, supporting inefficiencies, lack of administrative skills and transparency are supported by pure greed.Not to be outdone by the other SOE s, there is the SABC. The capture of this valuable national communications entity, a non-example of what can be a real independent broadcasting institution without favour, is being manipulated and mismanaged by individuals with personal agendas and as a fiefdom, supported by an equally unaccountable board.It is high time that something is done to save or disband these organizations. We cannot afford further gross mismanagement as reflected in recent events at Eskom, PetroSA, the above-mentioned, SAA and others.READ MORE: Entrepreneur advises: Talk to everybody I have always held education in high esteem and have spent the past eighteen years directly involved in tertiary education in my role as Chair of TSA (3 years) and Chairperson of Council of UNISA (15 years). I am however concerned with what is happening in our tertiary institutions today and Government s relentless efforts to devalue the current governance structures in these institutions.Government s proposed meddling in University management will leave these institutions and tertiary education in disarray- if allowed to.A general lack of policy certainty and the Government s perceived reluctance to implement the National Development Programme (NDP) will not allow our economy to grow at the four to six percent (4% to 6%) required for sustainable job creation and economic and social infrastructure development.By relentlessly pursuing trumped up charges against the Minister of Finance, the chances of an investment downgrade was made probable by the immense public clumsiness of the Head of the NPA, and his handlers, a reality.READ MORE: Country at one of the lowest points in its history says Mathews PhosaThe resultant intervention by the President to ask the Head of the NPA and two others to provide him with reasons why they should not be suspended is too late, suspicious and unfortunately in the wrong forum.The correct forum to deal with this matter is the General Council of the Bar of Advocates. I do not envy them their task to deal with Advocate Abrahams, who will leave the NPA with a legacy of intense public and political distrust, a broken institution and an absolute lack of leadership.The public war of words between the NPA and the Hawks is further evidence at what a divided and broken public administration the President has created. Our public service should never become the spineless lapdogs of unscrupulous politicians.In terms of improving our public service, it is my proposal that the Auditor-General should be given additional constitutional powers so that he or she can recommend remedial actions regarding his or her current powers of findings only. This will enable him or her to ensure that the current shocking mismanagement of public funds are addressed more thoroughly.On nuclear power, we should immediately end our dangerous flirtation with this form of energy and those who are attempting to seduce us into it s huge expensive and corruptive arms. One of the benefits of the departure of the former CEO of Eskom is that the deliberate positioning of nuclear energy against renewable energy will now end. Renewable energy should be a priority and is, without a doubt, a safer, cleaner and less expensive alternative in the longer term.READ MORE: Dr Mathews Phosa speaks out against ANC, Zuma and corruptionOur business leaders, government, labour and civil society must get together to develop a programme that will allow our economy to resume its leadership position in Africa and make us globally competitive.South Africa became a multiparty democracy in 1994. We have been politically free for the past twenty-two years.We must bequeath to our children a South Africa that is well led politically, well governed economically, and is based on strong ties between government, business and labour. It is achievable.We have enormous human potential, fantastic resources, wonderful business leaders and competitive products on the global market.We deserve and demand better political leadership. If we do not get it, we will use the ballot box to change those that serve at the electorate s pleasure.I believe in South Africa and I invite you on a journey with me to change negatives into positives so that we can leave a South Africa to our children and grandchildren that they can be proud of.
