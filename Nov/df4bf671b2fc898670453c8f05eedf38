MBOMBELA &#8211; With only a few weeks left before Father Christmas makes his way around the globe, Pro Gratia Learning Centre held a Christmas market on Friday evening.The unique market offered fun festivities and, of course, shopping for the whole family. Shoppers were spoiled for choice as there was a great variety of home-made products such as Christmas trees, arts and crafts, and delicious food on offer.The school is located on the outskirts of town on the R40 to Barberton. The premises has a farm atmosphere, and is currently home to 67 pupils with special educational needs.The learning centre&#8217;s new premises allows sufficient space for the planned development of a sports field. Currently no formal extracurricular sport activities are presented at the centre, but the children have access to private lessons in music, photography, dance and art.All proceeds of the night market will go towards improving the school. According to co-organisers, Nicodene van Rooyen and Carina Peach, the main aim was to raise funds and market the school.&#8220;This is the first time the school is hosting an event of this magnitude. The market is about bringing families together. Tonight is about shopping for Christmas. There is no need to worry about what to eat later &#8211; people can eat and shop here,&#8221; Peach said.&#8220;Our aim is to build more classes, sports fields and buy special equipment for children with special needs. We are planning to do another one next year and our wish is to see it get bigger and better. We also want to thank the parents and sponsors for their support. Without them this would not have been possible,&#8221; Van Rooyen added.
