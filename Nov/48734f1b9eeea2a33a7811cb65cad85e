KOMATIPOORT &#8211; Ahead of the festive season, more contraband shoes and cosmetic products are being smuggled into South Africa, but less illegal liquor.Lt Col Piet Paxton, staff officer of operational communications for the SANDF Joint Operations Division at headquarters, told Lowvelder this week that there was a general increase in smuggling at this time of year.Contraband valued at more than R1,4 million was seized by the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) on the Mozambican border over the past few days.It included R650 000 worth of counterfeit branded T-shirts and more than R700 000 worth of trainers and running shoes.More than 9 000 T-shirts were confiscated at the border.SANDF s Operation Corona s border-protection soldiers also confiscated illegal cigarettes valued at over R464 000 this month.The operation has also managed to prevent R237 000 worth of stolen and hijacked vehicles from leaving the country.Seven suspects were also apprehended by soldiers and handed over to police this month.Operation Corona is part of the SANDF s supportive role on the border.Paxton said there was an escalation in the contraband being smuggled over the border due to the pending holidays. During the holidays there will be more consumers for these products on the streets and a higher demand. He explained there was a particular increase in shoes and cosmetic products being smuggled into the country, but there was a decrease in the smuggling of illegal liquor.In October contraband to the value of R552 000 was confiscated by the SANDF at both the Mozambican and Swaziland borders.More than 56 kilograms of dagga was seized. One-hundred-and-sixty immigrants were also handed over to SAPS custody, while 12 vehicles were prevented from leaving South Africa illegally.The SANDF is cooperating with vehicle-tracking companies to track down hijackers and car thieves.Paxton said more stolen and hijacked vehicles were finding their way out of the country via KwaZulu-Natal.Trainers and takkies are popular goods to smuggle across the border What few people know is that not only do we have the mandate to physically apprehend illegal immigrants crossing the border and to confiscate contraband, but we are also mandated to carry out these duties within a corridor of 10 kilometres from the international border or the point of entry, if we suspect any illegal activities, said Paxton.However, the SANDF does not have the right to arrest anybody, only to apprehend, detain and control. We have no control over what happens once we have given the immigrants, suspects or contraband over to SAPS. The law must take its course, said Paxton.A part of the strategy going forward is to bring more mobility to platforms on the border. A new mobility package has been acquired by the SANDF and will be rolled out next week.
