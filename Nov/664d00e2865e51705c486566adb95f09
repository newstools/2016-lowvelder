In promotion material, BIVE has used an image of a house in Cape Town, which appears on Morukuru.com and claimed it as a how house of BIVE.Various other images used in marketing material, carrying the BIVE logo, were also investigated and found not to be connected to the company.Lowvelder s online editor Mr Benno Stander performed a reverse search on some of these images and discovered that they were in turn lifted from a number of other sites, some of existing developments located in amongst others India and the United Kingdom.Erasmus explained that the image of the house in Cape Town was never used to imply the house was completed or the exact show house, it was merely to illustrate what the houses currently under construction will look like once completed. Nowhere does it state or imply that any of those images are referring to anything that might already be on BIVE, but rather are intended to give an impression of what can be expected on the various sections of the estate. BIVE is like my child. There is not a thing I would have promised that I was not prepared to deliver. I sold it myself, nobody did anything for me. I cannot afford to (make false promises), Erasmus said.
