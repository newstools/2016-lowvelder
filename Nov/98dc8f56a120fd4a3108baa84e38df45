MBOMBELA &#8211; It is either a lonely life in the middle of nowhere or the experience of a lifetime. The life of an expat in Zambia is what you make of it. After gaining first-hand experience of life in three Zambian expat communities, Lowvelder tells the story of an existence that very few locals get to experience.Two former Hoedspruiters left the country in 2006. Neither want to be identified, but allowed Lowvelder a peek into their Mazabuka, Lusaka and Mkushi homes over the years. The first was in Mazabuka in the country&#8217;s Central Province. The couple lived in Cha Cha Cha Street, a dirt road where friendly locals dressed in shweshwe roamed and the odd street vendor would come and go.
