MBOMBELA &#8211; Jock&#8217;s October event was held in aid of Child Welfare Nelspruit. It meant that the full price of every R100 ticket went straight to the non-governmental organisation which relies heavily on external fund-raising for its operations.According to office manager for the Mbombela branch, Nomfundo Myeza, the subsidy they receive from the Department of Social Development goes toward paying employees&#8217; salaries.&#8220;We need to find extra funding for all food parcels, groceries, school uniforms for the children and empowerment programmes. We are so grateful to Jock for providing the venue for free and organising the whole occasion for us,&#8221; Myeza said.Also read: Charity warms hearts by warming headsVarious businesses and restaurants sponsored prizes for the bingo winners; from cooler boxes to meals at hotels and weekends away.Glaswegian pals and Jock regulars, Ian Munro and James Gibb, had everyone entertained as the bingo masters for the evening. Some of their Scottish references went over the participants&#8217; heads and their unique accents had people listening carefully for the numbers.General manager of Jock, Morgan Jenkins, said the initiative started last month when a friend was diagnosed with leukaemia. The proceeds from the first charity night were donated to The Sunflower Fund, a non-profit organisation dedicated to creating awareness, educating the public and facilitating the registration process for people to join the South African Bone Marrow Registry.Also read: Charity starts on the greensNext month&#8217;s event will be held to raise money for &#8220;Movember&#8221; and men&#8217;s health.&#8220;People don&#8217;t really get the opportunity to do much charity work these days. We are all so busy doing our own thing. It is nice to be able to give back. We hope to keep the monthly Bingo nights going,&#8221; Jenkins said.Check out the gallery of all the Bingo fun below:
