SKUKUZA &#8211; Guests of Kruger National Park were advised earlier tonight by the Kruger National Park to avoid using Phabeni and Paul Kruger Gates due to protest activity taking place between Hazyview and the Phabeni Gate turn off.Numbi Gate is the recommended alternative gate for entry and exit until further notice.Lesley Nyawo, public relations assistant of the KNP&#8217;s communications and marketing department, said that apparently a funeral held for a poacher led to the demonstration.At 19:00 no member of SAPS at both Calcutta and Hazy View stations had information available re the protest action.
