MBOMELA &#8211; &#8220;The doctors brought my smile back. God sent me to them. I want Him to bless everyone and their families who helped me,&#8221; Hadebe told Lowvelder yesterday morning. He underwent a seven-hour operation to remove a tumour from his jaw on Thursday.The growth would have fatally blocked his airway within a year. Rob Ferreira Hospital referred him to Steve Biko Hospital in Pretoria, where he was placed on a seven-year waiting list.Also see: PREVIEW: Vital operation will change man s lifeDr Pieter Scheepers, a maxilla facial surgeon at Lowveld Hospital, performed the massive reconstructive surgery &#8211; free of charge &#8211; with the help of Dr Barry Geldenhuys. The hospital also made its operating theatre, equipment and staff available for free.Additionally, Dr Hannes Raath donated the money required to pay for Hadebe&#8217;s prosthesis. The Nelspruit Anaesthetists Association also gave its services free of charge.Lowveld Hospital&#8217;s customer relationship manager, Ms Lisa Volbrecht, said he had been a different person before the surgery, &#8220;He was shy to talk to anyone, but now he oozes confidence and he is so talkative.&#8221;Hadebe is excited about his new life. He thanked everyone for helping him, especially his wife.We have been married for 14 years. Of those, I had the tumour for 12. Lindiwe never ran away from me. She supported me. I love her so much,&#8221; he said.His appearance has since cost him his job as a security guard, but Hadebe can now again look for work. Mostly, he wants to assist his beloved wife who has stood by him, and supported him. &#8220;I am a very hard worker,&#8221; he said.Hadebe will be discharged on Friday, but will need additional surgeries to have teeth implants and to rebuild the muscles in his jaw.&#8220;We still have a long way to go,&#8221; Volbrecht said, then added that the hospital still needed assistance from the community to continue helping him, such as covering his medication costs.Also read: Parents grateful for the community s supportDonations can be made into Lowveld Hospital&#8217;s bank account, ref: Sipho Hadebe Lowveld Hospital (Pty) Ltd Bank: Investec Acc No: 10011321292 Branch: 580105.Lowveld Hospital would like to thank each person for their contribution, and asks that everyone opening their hearts to this cause, please send his/her name to 082-924-9843 or crm@lowveldhospital (not compulsory).
