International petroleum prices have come off their late-October highs and it could mean that there will be a fuel price decrease in the near future according to the Automobile Association, which was commenting on the yet to be audited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. International oil prices remained stable throughout October, but have been in decline since November began, the AA added. The Rand / US Dollar exchange rate firmed over the same period, making a welcome contribution to the picture. The AA also warned that the Rand had weakened severely against the US Dollar in the wake of the US election results. He also said that if the Rand did not return to its previous levels, the fuel price picture could not be as alluring by month-end anymore. The currency is now also vulnerable to possible shifts in US policy when president-elect, Donald Trump, takes office early in 2017, the AA said. In addition to short-term fluctuations, the rand remains exposed to a possible ratings downgrade in South Africa, the AA commented.READ MORE: 10 Petrol saving tipsThe AA suggests that a reduction of 45 cents per litre of fuel, with a reduction of 38 cents per litre of diesel and a 40 cent reduction for illuminating paraffin could be on the horizon.The AA said: While the expected reduction at the pumps ahead of the 2016 Christmas season is welcome, South Africans would be prudent not to expect sustained drops in the fuel price over the next few months. 93 Petrol November Price: R12.79 Expected Price: R12.34Diesel (wholesale) November Price: R11.35 Expected Price: R10.97
