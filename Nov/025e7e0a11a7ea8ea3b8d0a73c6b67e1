Among them is Orange River Cellars. Unlike the majority of local wine which is produced in the Western Cape, it&#8217;s located in Upington. This unique geography, which attracts hundreds of wine enthusiasts from all over the world each year, produces the Muscat grape &#8211; a distinctively sweet varietal that is used to make its aromatic range of Cape Ruby, White Jerepigo, Red Jerepigo, Medium Cream, Old Brown, Full Cream, Hanepoot as well as White and Red Muscadels.Cellar master Gert Visser shares how a combination of clean air, soil, sun and a great river running through it, has put Orange River Cellars on the international map with its award-winning dessert wines. Muscadel, also known as Muscat, is a red and white grape variety and is most often consumed as a sweet dessert wine. To gain full sweetness, the grapes are harvested at the desired sugar levels while extracting flavour from the skins. Once the skin contact period is over the juice gets removed and fortified with alcohol. This gives it its signature sweetness. Visser says its best enjoyed in a number of ways. &#8220;Thanks to its sweetness and easy-drinking nature, both the red and white Muscadels work well on their own, make great aperitifs, or even cocktails.READ MORE: Food and wine paired to perfectionThough Muscadel has typically been more popular among an older market, we have definitely seen an increase in younger wine-lovers purchasing this type of wine. They drink it with crushed ice or follow cocktail trends. We&#8217;ve even created some interesting and fun cocktail combinations ourselves,&#8221; he said. His signature cocktail recipe is the White Muscadel &#8220;MintZing&#8221;. &#8220;To make it you&#8217;ll need a bottle of white Muscadel, a few mint leaves, a thin slice of lemon, soda water and a tall cocktail glass filled to the brim with crushed ice. &#8220;It&#8217;s a real thirst quencher and a great companion on a hot summer&#8217;s day. Or, if you&#8217;re looking for something funkier, try &#8216;The Witches Brew&#8217;.It combines Red Muscadel with Brut sparkling wine. &#8220;Add a thinly sliced strawberry and ample crushed ice and enjoy this exotic pink combination.&#8221; He added that the red complements cheeses and rich pasta dishes, while the white pairs well with fresh fruit, soup, mildly spiced dishes and sweet desserts.The TOPS at SPAR Wine Show is taking place at Emnotweni.
