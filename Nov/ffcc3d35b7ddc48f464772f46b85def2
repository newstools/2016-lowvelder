When visiting the Bazaruto Island View Estate (BIVE) website there is a clear contrast between pictures depicting current progress and those displayed in the Estate Sections category. These images, supposedly depicting, private residence, the beach lodge, holiday resort, luxury homes, a medical facility, lakeside lodge, small crafts marina, central office and rental agent, are in fact all pictures of 5-star lodges from around the world. The images appear to have been &#8216;taken&#8217; from the internet before the BIVE logo was added. No reference or credit is made to these 5-star establishments on the BIVE website.Using Google s search by image function, it was possible to track down the origins of these photos. This search function allows you to search for images on the web, using an image. Google then finds similar or the same images, using the one you provide as a reference.This very handy tool is often used by owners of copyrighted images to determine whether their graphics are used on the internet without their permission. With this function it was determined that these branded images were in fact copied from travel agencies websites, and depict hotels and lodges in places quite far from Mozambique. In fact, the Caribbean, Mauritius, India, the Dominican Republic, Fiji and Maldives feature in these images, but not Mozambique.Below are the images as they appeare on the BIVE website, with a description of what destination it actually resembles.
