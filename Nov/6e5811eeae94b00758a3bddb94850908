Thandi and Tebogo are looking forward to their family vacation in Underberg in the southern Drakensberg area of KwaZulu-Natal with their baby boy Lebo.They will be driving from Johannesburg to their destination and are looking forward to making pit stops in small towns they have never heard of.With all the excitement, and it being Thandi and Tebogo&#8217;s first long distance trip with their two year old they have a lot to take into consideration. For a journey of about five hours they have to think about nappy changes, feeding and prepare for the unexpected as far as possible.For their own entertainment they have compiled a playlist of Tebogo&#8217;s kwaito music and Thandi&#8217;s old school R&amp;B.Thandi being the organised mother that she is, decided it would be a good idea to pack the car the night before. Here&#8217;s her baby checklist.Now all that&#8217;s left to do is to get the show on the road. They are leaving before dawn to make optimal use of the fact that Lebo will be asleep and to ease him into the long drive ahead.Follow the family on their trip to the Drakensberg, see where they&#8217;ll stop and what they&#8217;ll do.For car or tyre care tips and advice, follow Dunlop on Twitter and Facebook, and click here to download your free Dunlop Zone Tyre Tips booklet.Why not join us in our conversation!
