It&#8217;s first light and Thandi and Tebogo are up and ready for their trip to Underberg in the southern Drakensberg area of KwaZulu-Natal. Their preparations for the trip paid off and all they need to do now is to get Lebo in his car seat and to hit the N3.Their estimated time for the trip is a little over five hours which gives them more than enough time to take pictures of the beautiful scenery and to do some exploring.At Heidelberg just outside Joburg, Tebogo stops for their first nappy change. They pass a beautiful old sandstone church and Tebogo takes a few pictures. Parked under a tree on the church grounds they decide to breakfast on their packed padkos.After a few hours the family reaches Van Reenen&#8217;s Pass which seems to stand guard at the top of this majestic pass which winds its way through the Drakensberg mountains between Ladysmith and Harrismith along the N3. Once through the pass they are in KwaZulu-Natal.One of the places that the family have marked on their route, is the Mandela Capture site near Howick. This is where Nelson Mandela was captured in 1962. Today this site is marked by an impressive sculpture.After taking pictures and letting Lebo run around a little, they enjoy the rest of their padkos and hit the road again for the last stretch of their journey. Underberg here they come!The family have enjoyed every moment of their road trip making it part of their holiday and taking their time. They are completely relaxed and looking forward to their holiday.Before embarking on a long journey, make sure that you have checked the following:Tyres: Spare wheel, jack, wheel spanner, safety triangleFluids: Oil, water, battery waterBrakes: Brake pads, break fluidWhy not join us in our conversation!
