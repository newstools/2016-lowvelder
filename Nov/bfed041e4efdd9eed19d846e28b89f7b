MBOMBELA &#8211; An ACS security guard was shot in the leg while investigating the cause of an alarm on the perimeter fence of Bateleur Estate. According to ACS Security Nelspruit manager, Mr Hennie Potgieter, the incident occurred on Sunday at 01:15.&#8220;Our security guard, Mr Nathi Bogani, was patrolling the outside perimeter of the fence when the alarm went off,&#8221; he said. Bogani went to inspect what had triggered the alarm. &#8220;He was walking on the wall inspecting the fence when shots were fired at him from outside, so he dove for cover,&#8221; said Potgieter. Bogani could not see where the shots were coming from but returned fire.He said he started to feel dizzy and then realised he had been shot. Potgieter said when the alarm went off their armed response was dispatched to the scene. &#8220;Our armed response saw upon arrival that Bogani had been shot. Due to the terrain they did not wait for an ambulance and immediately rushed him to Rob Ferreira Hospital,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The incident was reported to police, but they only arrived at the hospital when the doctors were busy with Bogani,&#8221; he said. Bateleur Estate&#8217;s Mr John Wilcox said he was aware of the incident. &#8220;It did not happen inside the estate, but we are aware of an incident that happened outside,&#8221; he said.Wilcox explained that ACS Security was in charge of guarding the perimeters of the estate. Capt Dawie Pretorius said the incident was reported to police at the time. &#8220;By the time the police got there, there was nobody at the scene as the guard had already been taken to hospital,&#8221; he said.That is why no forensics or ballistics were done at the scene. Pretorius said the police had arranged to meet Bogani to get his statement on Monday and to open a case of attempted murder.Read more here: Man on ARVs after attack by squatter
