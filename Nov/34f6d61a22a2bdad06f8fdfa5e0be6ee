MBOMBELA &#8211; The Communio City Changers left everyone who attended its concert over the weekend, inspired.The Big Thing Production was presented at Communio Church in Mbombela on Sunday. It was centred on being a city changer and helping to impact the different spheres of the community.Past Freddie Steenkamp, visionary leader for Communio City Changers, a church that is part of the Apostolic Faith Mission, believes that people can make a difference in any sphere they work or live in. The spheres are divided into eight different sectors consisting of church and family, business, media, arts, government, sport, social services and education. Strategies have been put into place to help them face the challenges of making the city a better place.The atmosphere was inspiring and positive. The production saw an array of talent, all portraying city changers. The venue was full and everyone who attended thoroughly enjoyed the music and the dancing. The church&#8217;s band and choir led in song, followed by the talented angelic voices of the Meridian Choir. A video of the Lowveld was screened, showing everyone the true beauty of the area. Children of the Communio congregation put on a wonderful dance, with ribbons and flags. Silent Night was performed, and actors depicting baby Jesus, along with Mary and Joseph, took to the stage and engaged the crowd in the spirit of Christmas.To conclude the production, prominent members of the community, who are impacting society in a positive way, were called on stage. Steenkamp ended the event with a prayer. A tasty lunch was enjoyed by all afterwards. Each member of the congregation made a wonderful dish, and guests could have a taste of everything on offer.The Communio dream is to raise city changers who live to change Mbombela, and the production did a wonderful job of inspiring everyone who attended.
